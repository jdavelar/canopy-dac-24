============= FIRST VERSION GRAPHS ===============
### Across schools
Graph #1 looks at selection of tags across our whole sample, i.e., the number reflects the percentage of our total sample of schools that selected each tag. (AKA across schools)

One of the questions we were hoping to investigate with this graph is whether the selection of blended learning tags may be due to changes in our survey design through the introduction of parent/child tags. We do see a sharp decrease in child tags in 2023. However, the selection for the parent tag `blended learning` remains high. All school leaders that selected `blended learning` would have received a follow-up question about the type of blended learning they use with our child tags listed below. This makes me think that schools are still using blended learning, but perhaps did not see their approach to blended learning reflected in our child tags. (So what are they using...?)

```{r}
blended <- dat %>% 
  filter(var %in% blended_tags) %>%
  group_by(var, year) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(usage)) %>% 
  ungroup()
tots <- dat %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(total = n_distinct(school_id)) %>% 
  unique()
blended <- blended %>% 
  left_join(tots, by = "year") %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/total) %>% 
  left_join(labels, by = "var")
#build plot
#palette colors
palette <- c("#BC2582", "#FFA630","#FFDE42","#99C24D","#218380","#D3B7D7")
#labels
labs <- blended %>% 
  filter(year == 2024) %>% 
  select(label, x = year, y = pct)
#plot
blended %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, pct, color = label)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.025, .3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text(data = labs, 
            aes(label = label, 
                x = x, 
                y = y),
            hjust = -.05)
```

### Across schools (no COVID)

What if we omit 2021 to account for the big jump?

```{r}
blended <- dat %>% 
  filter(var %in% blended_tags) %>%
  filter(year != 2021) %>% 
  group_by(var, year) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(usage)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(tots, by = "year") %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/total) %>% 
  left_join(labels, by = "var")

#plot
blended %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, pct, color = label)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.025, .3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text(data = labs, 
            aes(label = label, 
                x = x, 
                y = y),
            hjust = -.05)
```

### Within schools (no COVID)
Again, what if we omit 2021?

```{r}
#data
blended <- dat %>% 
  #filter only blended tags
  filter(var %in% blended_tags) %>% 
  #filter only repeat schools
  filter(school_id %in% repeaters) %>% 
  #drop 2021 year
  filter(year != 2021) %>% 
  #create wave variable
  arrange(school_id, year) %>% 
  group_by(school_id) %>%
  mutate(wave = dense_rank(year)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  #create change column
  arrange(school_id, year) %>%
  group_by(school_id, var) %>%
  mutate(change = usage - lag(usage)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  #create add/drop columns
  mutate(adds = ifelse(change == 1, 1, NA),
         drops = ifelse(change == -1, 1, NA)) %>%

### 2023 Drop Investigation

Investigating drop in blended learning tags in 2023.

*From CW*: Could you do a quick tally of: 
a) how many schools in 2022 chose any of the child tags WITHOUT choosing "blended learning"

There were 21 instances where a school leader chose child tags but did not choose blended learning.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2022) %>% 
  filter(var %in% blended_tags) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "var",
              values_from = "usage") %>% 
  group_by(school_id) %>% 
  mutate(children = case_when(
    practices_a_la_carte == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_flex == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_flipped_classroom == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_enriched_virtual == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_station_rotation == 1 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  ),
  childless = case_when(
    practices_blended_learning == 1 & children == 0 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  ),
  parentless = case_when(
    practices_blended_learning == 0 & children == 1 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarize(selected_children = sum(parentless),
            selected_parent_only = sum(childless)) %>% 
  datatable()
```


b) how many schools in 2023 chose "blended learning" as a parent tag but didn't choose any child tags?

There were 53 instances where a school leader chose blended learning but did not choose one of the child tags. (And 94 instances where they did choose child tags, for comparison.)

```{r}
dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2023) %>% 
  filter(var %in% blended_tags) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "var",
              values_from = "usage") %>% 
  group_by(school_id) %>% 
  mutate(children = case_when(
    practices_a_la_carte == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_flex == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_flipped_classroom == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_enriched_virtual == 1 ~ 1,
    practices_station_rotation == 1 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  ),
  childless = case_when(
    practices_blended_learning == 1 & children == 0 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarize(selected_parent = sum(childless),
            selected_children = sum(children)) %>% 
  datatable()
```

# Models

```{r}
#set up model function
tag_bayes <- function(data, id = "school_id", cov, threshold = NULL) {
  mod_dat <- data %>%
    select(id, cov, starts_with("practices")) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("practices"), names_to = "tag", values_to = "value") %>%
    na.omit()

  if (!is.null(threshold)) {
    mod_dat <- mod_dat %>% filter(value > threshold)
  }

  numeric_covs <- sapply(mod_dat[, cov], is.numeric) %>% names() %>% intersect(cov)
  mod_dat <- mod_dat %>%
    group_by(tag) %>%

    ungroup()

      prior = student_t(df = 7, location = 0, scale = 2.5),
      seed = 123
    ))

  bayes_tidy <- bayes_mods %>%
    purrr::map_dfr(tidy, .id = "tag") %>%
    filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
    mutate(
      nice_tag = label_tags(tag),
      nice_demog = factor(label_dems(term))
    )

  return(bayes_tidy)
}
