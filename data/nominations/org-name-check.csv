Nominator_2022-11_Education Counsel_,Education Counsel,"The Virginia Beach City Public School’s Environmental Studies Program at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Brock Environmental Center is on the forefront of reimagining the structures of high school through student empowerment and giving students a voice in the community. This facility, where 11th and 12th grade students come to learn every day, is located in the middle of a free public park called Pleasure House Point Natural Area. The 118 acre park is a living laboratory for learning, and it is as much of a classroom space for the students as the actual building they learn in. The building in the park where students attend classes is on the Lynnhaven River at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, and it is not a school building. Instead, students attend classes at the regional headquarters of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. All students, while at the CBF Brock Environmental Center, are learning in the tenth living building in the world. Students not only get to work with teachers but also get to work directly with members of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, whose inclusive efforts connect students to real-world, relevant work spanning 6 states and the District of Columbia. 
 The Virginia Beach City Public School’s Environmental Studies Program helps students connect their passions to career paths through personalized internships. The internships, a critical component of the program, connect students with community partners to gain career experience; showcasing the vibrant expanse of organizations connected to science and sustainability in our community. Environmental architectural design, fisheries ecology, horticultural studies, audio engineering, forestry and water impoundment studies, outdoor education, environmental policy, eco tourism, and solar installation contracting; this range of internship opportunities cultivates passion and career advancement.

Nominator_2022-11_Revolution School_,Revolution School,"Revolution is not just an innovative new high school. We are also a diverse network of collaborators engaging in educational change. Our goals are to expand learning choices in schools to ensure opportunity readiness for all to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in education and the future of work.

School innovation requires a coalition. Revolution School executes a new high school model designed to unleash the learning that happens when students and communities come together to listen, learn and lead.  Our opportunity readiness skill building program designed with and for diverse young people, and paired with an authentic community, ignites the ingenuity we need for both the present and future of work. 

To achieve our goals, we harness the resources of local communities and organizations across Philadelphia and beyond. We aim for those who would otherwise not meet organically to disrupt the silos. We have thus far built a network of over 2000 community members, 200 of whom actively engage in the programming of the Revolution School. 

We closely collaborate with partners to deliver a curriculum that develops skills, habits and dispositions for action. While foundational skills are built through systematic practice, they are internalized when used through purposeful action. 

Instead of sitting in a classroom to learn about democracy, students work with community organizers to get out the vote during an election. Instead of laborious writing exercises, students pitch project ideas and set up informational interviews with community leaders.  Instead of presenting only to peers, students attend meetings with the Streets Department to represent youth voice in debates on bike lanes. These experiences are not extra, they are our program.

Revolution School uniquely connects students across Philadelphia to problem solvers, innovative leaders, and creative thinkers and prepares them to one day step into those roles themselves.

Nominator_2020-11_Fielding International_,Fielding International,"Over the past four years, Hilton Head Christian Academy has partnered with Fielding International to design, develop, and deliver the best combination of educational spaces aligned to innovative learning strategies, as the school transitions from traditional teaching methodologies to project- and inquiry-based, experiential learning practices.  During the building development phase, the design team worked closely with regional architects to blend Hilton Head�s natural environment and school culture into structural realities as they transition off Hilton Head Island and read a larger more diverse demographic in Blufton. A large investment into on-site exposure and training aided the entire school community in understanding the value of open-design concepts, why seating and learning communities need to be flexible and serve multiple purposes, and how to maximize authentic learning opportunities within and around the physical building.  Consistent reviews of best practices and local regulations mirrored the academic process underlying the pedagogical shift and engaged a multitude of stakeholders (families, faculty, community, alumni, and students) in the design process.  Increased student voice and agency in the means by which learning can happen manifest a more interactive approach to learning at school; even under the current, physically-distanced limitations, the pillars for collaborative, creative, and authentic learning communities have been placed.    Through the introduction of pathfinders to practice new learning spaces, hands-on professional developments to craft projects and integrate inquiry, and a wide variety of curricular resources to orient thought, HHCA is now equipped to effectively lead the advancement of education in the state and across the Southeast.  Fielding International�s partnership in this endeavor has placed HHCA in a position to meet its internal goals and exceed its original external expectations.  From flex-mod scheduling to scaffolded authentic challenges to learning suites that house multi-grade instruction and competency-based, cross-curricular, core content classes, the growth is immeasurable.

Nominator_2021-12_MiCoOp_,MiCoOp,"In 2019, four Bangor teachers were trained in project-based learning (PBL). These three high school teachers and one middle school teacher not only provide personalized learning for their students on a regular basis but are also a PBL resource for other teachers in the district. This proved beneficial when the district implemented a Project Term at the end of the 2020-21 school year. 

To develop the five-week Project Term schedule, teachers first created a list of potential offerings. Then students “voted” on their top choices, ending with a schedule that would fulfill student needs and wants. Ending the year in this manner motivated both staff and students who had voice and choice for what they wanted to teach or learn. Courses were multi-grade (e.g., 6-8, 9-12) instead of grade level (e.g., 6th ELA), were outcome-based (credit or no credit) rather than standards-based which is used in regular terms, and were nontraditional in the way content was covered. A block format was used so students had longer class periods to work on projects. Because this inaugural Project Term was during COVID, some students chose to complete their courses from home so teachers had fewer students in their classrooms and taught the rest of the class virtually. Students who successfully completed their core courses were able to choose a full schedule of elective classes. 

In addition to credit recovery courses, some courses offered during Project Term included Creating a Personal Budget, Photo Journalism, Fly Fishing, Kitchen Chemistry, Basic Reading and Writing, Art of War: Chess, and ESL Story Tellers. They plan to have Project Term again at the end of 2021-22. By reimagining what ""school"" can look like during Project Term, the staff and students are beginning to see how they can change their school structure to include more PBL throughout the year.

Nominator_2021-12_MiCoOp_,MiCoOp,"Students in the DP Diploma Programme become lifelong learners as they learn to be critical and compassionate thinkers. In the program, students reflect on the question “How do we know?”, write a 4,000-word independent essay paper, and complete a creativity, activity, or service project. Each student prepares a portfolio of their work. This two-year, comprehensive curriculum culminates with an IB Diploma which is recognized by colleges and universities around the world.

All Oxford students are part of the district's IB program from PreK through 10th grade. Oxford's IB Diploma Programme is an option for students in 11th and 12th grade who want to continue with the IB program. (The district has three other high school pathways.) 

The outcome of the program is that students become more internationally minded, take action, and become better leaders and learners. At the elementary schools, fifth-grade students take action through a three-month, collaborative research project, and middle school students take action through a personal project. When visiting the district and talking with their high school students, it is apparent how the IB program is impacting their learning and growth.

There is a student lounge with a maker space, therapy dogs, and a weight room where students can go to relieve stress. They also have the ability to leave class with no questions asked.

Nominator_2020-11_NewSchools Venture Fund_Impact | Puget Sound Elementary,NewSchools Venture Fund,"Impact | Puget Sound Elementary (PSE) is the flagship campus for Impact Public Schools, the first homegrown Washington state elementary charter network. After opening in 2018, Impact | PSE has proven that its model has the ability to narrow, and eventually close, the opportunity gap for historically marginalized students in south Puget Sound. Impact | PSE uses a model rooted in three design principles:  [1] Relationships: Fostering secure attachments within a tight-knit community of learners using a small group mentor model. [2] Agency: Working with families and students to develop comprehensive, personalized learning pathways for each individual scholar [3] Liberation: Creating deep, authentic learning experiences for students that lead to activism through the exploration of contextualized topics that are relevant in students� communities.  The Impact | PSE model employs an expanded definition of student success. While Core Skills are critical to student success, Impact | PSE also believes that deeper learning skills and social-emotional skills are essential to support the next generation of equity-driven, innovative leaders. These three design principles are the foundation for achieving this vision of student success.   Impact | PSE�s implementation of a decolonized project-based learning (PBL) program is a stand-out element of the school model. The PBL curriculum has been designed to shift the dominant perspective and highlight voices, stories, and information that has not been emphasized in how students traditionally learn history. These projects lift up the indigenous perspective and work to break down institutional racism many educational systems continue to perpetuate. Impact | PSE operates with the belief that all scholars deserve to see themselves and their experiences reflected in what is being taught in their classrooms. All students deserve to learn about and be exposed to writers, artists, historians, community heroes and leaders who share their background and identity. In order for the Impact | PSE curriculum to be liberating, it must be rooted in the local communities it serves. At Impact | PSE, instructional leaders ensure that the liberated PBL model is replicable by developing a rigorous and relevant base curriculum that includes assessment tools, lesson plans and exemplars. Then, the school provides systems, structures (including a process for community/parent design input) and professional development to ensure the projects are rooted in the school community. This two-part method ensures that the curriculum is not rooted in the command, control and regurgitation of facts, but instead in the exploration of important, relevant questions that allow students to create real products and showcase them in front of a live audience of peers, parents and community members.",101,Anonymous

Rooted believes that all students should have equal access to programs that lead to financial independence. 
 

 1. 100% of Rooted School students are enrolled in technology-centered courses that are oriented towards students earning Industry Based Credentials. Students have the option take classes in 3D-printing, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Unity Virtual Video Game Design, Comp TIA+, and others. Students can earn up to 8 industry based credentials during their time at Rooted. 
 

 2. Students participate in self-directed learning and project based learning in all classes. Self-directed learning modules give students the opportunity to move at their own pace, and for teachers to provide students individualized instruction. Students also practice time-management skills. Project based learning experiences mimic the types of challenges and projects students will experience once they graduate. 
 

 3. Rooted School uses a competency based grading system. Students are graded on their demonstration of mastery of the subject matter, and have the opportunity to resubmit assignments to earn a higher grade. This grading system mimics how students will be expected to approach their tasks once in a career. 
 

 4. Students apply the knowledge they learn in their technology courses to internal and external internships. Internal internships include a digital media internship and IT help desk internship. Students get paid to use the skills they learned in their courses, while also preparing for their future career. 
 

 5. Rooted School is facilitating a direct-cash transfer program in collaboration with the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania. During the 22-23 school year, 88 students will participate in a Randomized Controlled Trial in which 44 students in a treatment group will receive $50/week for 40 weeks. The UPenn team will evaluate the impact of the cash transfers on students’ perceived financial wellbeing, attendance, and academic achievement.

Nominator_2020-11_MiCoOp_Oxford Virtual Academy,MiCoOp,"Oxford Virtual Academy (OVA) began 10 years ago as a virtual school, but has transformed into a true personalized learning environment that includes virtual, seated, blended, project-based, independent study, dual enrollment courses and more. Some courses use third-party vendor curriculum, but they also create custom courses for students or groups of students. The school has a drop-in learning space and offers courses with community partners.   OVA has a high level of academic rigor and requires 24 credits to graduate, but they offer many options for students to get there (i.e., multiple pathways to graduation). As Janet would describe, they are like the super highway to graduation because they offer the tools and capacity for students to choose their path and pace to graduation. Their student body is made up of students from different ethnic, socio-economic, and academic levels, yet each receives a personalized program to fit their needs. For example, traditionally homeschooled students may choose to enroll with OVA because they still have control over their learning with support from certified teachers. Students who want more rigor than the traditional school enroll to move ahead faster. The school has partnerships with foster care and court programs where they provide the path for those students to continue their education. One student may take courses from three different vendors while another is taking two online courses, two college courses, an art course at a local community partner, and getting credit for a job through a work-based program.   I am always amazed at the perseverance and commitment they have for each individual student. Whether a student is in kindergarten or 10th grade, they don�t have to fit into the school�s box for learning. They can create their own path with the support from OVA�s administrators, counselors, teachers, and mentors. ",383,MiCoOp
Nominator_2020-11_MiCoOp_Gull Lake Virtual Partnership,MiCoOp,"Gull Lake Virtual Partnership (GLVP) has a strong commitment to personalized learning plans for all students. When schedules are created, they focus on the student and not a school schedule like traditional programs. Every student�s schedule is created based on their unique goals and plans. For example, one student may take all online courses while another student takes two online courses, one community partnership course, one college course, one project-based learning course, and has an internship. Students can choose from fully online courses, blended learning opportunities, dual enrollment, Early College or advanced course options, and other Gull Lake Community Schools buildings� offerings.   The flexibility offered by GLVP is attractive to K-12 full-time students, part-time students, home school students, and nonpublic/shared time students who want to discover their own individual talents. A range of virtual learning platforms are available to meet the needs of students. The school partners with community experts to offer optional learning experiences that allow virtual students to apply their learning. These elective virtual courses are designed in collaboration between a community expert and a GLVP teacher so that accurate content and effective online course design are both present. In addition to taking the online course, students have the option to attend an in-person session with the community expert. Unique course offerings include Reverse Engineering, Wilderness Survival and Adventuring, Confectionery Art, and Latin.   While many traditional schools say they are preparing their students for career and college, they try to fit the student into their programs. GLVP creates the program to fit the student. In their Early College program, students can choose from three different universities to receive an associates degree. Courses are offered both online and face-to-face with many supports from both GLVP and the colleges. In their senior year, students can choose to take a math for college success course that was created in partnership between the high school, GLVP, and a local community college.",384,MiCoOp

Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Central Vermont Career Center,Vermont Agency of Education,"As a local control state, when Vermont transitioned to proficiency based graduation requirements, each school district was left to develop its own specific requirements, informed by resources provided by the Agency of Education. Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion.

Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_River Bend Career & Technical Center,Vermont Agency of Education,"River Bend Career and Technical Center is a regional technical center that serves high school students from five sending school districts in Vermont and New Hampshire. It is a located in a very rural part of the state. Its high sending schools are small -- each with no more than 300 students in grades 9 through 12, and some with half that number.  On the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V)accountability measure for nontraditional program concentration, River Bend Career and Technical Center has the highest performance in Vermont. Defined as ""CTE concentrators enrolled in programs leading to a field non-traditional for their gender, as well as non-binary, non-conforming, and transgender students,"" River Bend Career and Technical Center's three year average is 21.01%, compared to the overall state average of 11.71%.  River Bend Career and Technical Center believes this data represents work the center has done to create a safe, respectful, inclusive culture. Despite the fact that they have the highest performance on this measure in the state, the school's leadership team recognizes that there is more work to be done. Their Perkins V Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment identified areas for improvement, and their four year plan calls for continued work to increase the number of students enrolling in programs that are nontraditional for their gender.  In addition, after full staff training on preventing bullying and harassment and identifying and intervening when bullying and harassment occur, River Bend Career Technical Center gave deliberate consideration to creating learning environments that are safe and respectful for every student. As a result of this work, River Bend Career and Technical Center determined that they needed to have zero tolerance for displays of the Confederate flag (e.g. on student clothing, backpacks, notebooks, vehicles, etc.). Brian Emerson, the school's Director (Principal), reports that it was hard work, but they stayed the course. He notes that the work River Bend Career and Technical Center has done over the past five years has positioned them to continue to address issues of equity and inclusion and to work toward racial equity in a very rural community with limited racial diversity.",390,Vermont Agency of Education
Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Bellows Free Academy,Vermont Agency of Education,"Franklin West Supervisory Union (FWSU) has identified four target areas for continuous school improvement and student growth: student-centered, proficiency-based, personalized learning; flexible learning environments; student leadership; and engaged community partners. Along with all other schools in Vermont in compliance with Act 77, FWSU is also moving forward with a proficiency-based curriculum model that emphasizes essential academic concepts, content, and skills, including Transferable Skills, to help ensure our students are college and career-ready.? ?   The connections among the national standards, local curriculum, and classroom instruction and assessment play a critical role in an integrated design of engaging and relevant learning opportunities for students. Educators believe an integrated approach is the �best fit�� for meeting targets. Project-based learning (PjBL) is one strategy used for integrating content. Although there are currently PjBL �islands of excellence� in science and world language, implementing this approach holds the potential for growth in the future.   Proficiency-driven opportunities highlight learning that?is?personalized and learning environments that are flexible. FWSU�s goal is to ensure that their students receive a �future-ready, world-class education� and graduate with the knowledge and skills to successfully pursue their goals.    Bellows Free Academy (BFA), the supervisory union high school, has been leading this work and providing guidance for the elementary schools. Outcome proficiencies cut across all four years of high schools with performance indicators being used to determine proficiency. Educators are refining common assessments and provide different pathways for students to achieve expected outcomes. The principal of BFA is a master at developing a schedule with blocks of varying amounts of time to create a learning environment that is responsive to the needs of learners. There is a comprehensive approach to supporting students. Educators know their students deeply and create a culture that is connected and authentic.   Performance assessments in grades eight and ten prepare students for a capstone project in twelfth grade. There are also pathways to distinction that are available which are personalized according to a student�s interest. This opportunity �ignites a fire� for some students.  BFA administrators and staff have been engaged in learning and having conversations about equity for several years. Last spring, while on dismissal, racial justice became a  part of their student�s world. School had ended for the summer, but leadership knew they couldn�t wait for the fall to connect with students about this important issue. A group of teachers decided to put out an open invitation to have a discussion about what was going on in the world and how to move forward together. Around a dozen students joined the first zoom session. They asked questions about the return to school and other topics before the conversation shifted to equity and racial justice in their school. At first, the teachers facilitated the conversation, but somewhere in the middle of the summer, the students took over the agenda and the conversation. Their goal was to provide opportunities for the student body to join the conversation about racial justice in their school and in the world, and ultimately improve the culture of BFA. Thus, the Fairfax Racial Justice  Alliance (RJA) began. Since the start of the school year, students have been exposed to the four agreements and the compass from Courageous Conversations. They have had discussions about equity using case studies that explore socio-economic, cultural and racial bias, and equity. Work in advisory complements the goals of the BFA Fairfax  RJA.   Additionally, an early warning system approach is in place to examine if certain students are being marginalized. Educators recognize the importance of confronting evidence about which students are historically privileged, and which are not. This process is strengthening practices to support all learners. Both the student and the system levels are being analyzed to determine where inequities exist and how to implement change.

Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Randolph Union High School,Vermont Agency of Education,"  Randolph Union Middle/High School is designing for equity through the implementation of ongoing equity-focused professional development in the form of Professional Learning Communities. Faculty meet regularly in small groups to discuss current equity issues in the school and wider community, explore solutions, examine implicit bias, and to research and develop different curricular and pedagogical resources. These PLC groups provide a means through which to foster a culture of continuous equity learning amongst faculty, as well as a space to process personal experiences with inequity and bias. As part of RU's regularly scheduled professional development, the PLC structure is supporting faculty in developing equity as a lens through which to approach teaching and learning.  As part of this ongoing professional development, RU developed a set of social justice standards adapted from those published by Teaching Tolerance, called the Democratic Engagement Standards. These standards provide a structure through which teachers can design learning experiences that ask students to grapple with issues related to identity, equity, and structural injustice. RU is currently in the pilot year of using these standards, working towards identifying places in the curriculum that already provide opportunities to address these topics, in addition to places where these standards and topics could be further developed. As the Democratic Engagement Standards are not content-area specific, and can be integrated into any subject area, RU is actively working towards incorporating this essential work in classes beyond just the humanities.  The equity-focused PLC program also works to foster a culture of anti-racist action, encouraging teachers to collaboratively address systemic inequities in the school building. Student activism is encouraged and supported through project-based learning opportunities. Students organized and hosted the first ever state-wide student conference on racial justice in the Spring of 2019, bringing together students and activists from across Vermont. While the 2020 conference was postponed due to COVID-19, students continue to take action on injustice in their community through developing social justice lessons for younger students, writing letters to the editor, and supporting and amplifying the work of other activists in the state.

Hazen Union recently piloted a student-centered driven, student-designed, advanced manufacturing course and makerspace using student personalized learning plans (PLPs) as a tool for students to co-design and co-develop curriculum with teachers and community partners. This pilot expanded upon Hazen�s well-established Work-Based Learning (WBL) Program and Independent Based Learning (IBL) Program. In response to COVID-19, Hazen Union and community partners leveraged the grant funded equipment to print face shields for Vermont doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The community partners worked with the students virtually throughout the process, providing opportunities to engage in design-thinking methods and skill attainment that could be applied across contexts. Upon completion of the pilot, the student cohort presented their curriculum, reflections, and deliverables to OSSU School Board members with recommendations to support the sustainability of this program. Students were empowered to demonstrate their competency in communication, advocacy, and action research in order to maintain this student-centered program for their peers. The success of this program conveys the importance of education and community partnerships and the positive impact student voice has within the school system and the community at large.

Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Missisquoi Valley Union Middle and High School,Vermont Agency of Education,"The leadership team at Missisquoi Valley Union (MVU) Middle and High School was able to hold two preliminary meetings and a train-the-trainer workshop focused on equity literacy with Paul Gorski. All members of the MVU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (DEI) Committee have a solid understanding of the principles and practices of equity literacy in education.  Educators from Swanton and Sheldon were intensively introduced to these principles and practices.  At MVU, several members of the DEI Committee feel fully prepared to plan and offer equity literacy professional learning to the staff. Additionally, an equity student survey was created, and feedback provided by the Equity Literacy Institute.  Educators secured funding to get the results of the survey professionally analyzed through an equity lens.   MVU has met the expectation of Proficiency-Based Learning with a thoughtful transition.  Early work was done 7 years ago to prioritize standards and create clear learning expectations, learning scales for common summative assessments, and school-wide habits of work.  Over the past 4 years, educators have implemented a more refined version of proficiency-based learning which includes a transition to proficiency-based grades, personalized course offerings, and robust and flexible �keeping up and catching up� interventions.  As a highlight, the English Language Arts department has wholeheartedly embraced independent reading.  Students now meet their reading proficiencies by providing evidence from books that they choose.  Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: �	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. �	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. �	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: �	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. �	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. �	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: �	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. �	Begin Equity student focus groups. �	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. �	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. �	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. �	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL�s 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.

Nominator_2020-11_Empower Schools_Sam Houston Collegiate Preparatory Academy,Empower Schools,"Sam Houston is in year 1 of implementing the Third Future Schools model, which has completely changed the culture of the school and opportunities for students. The model focuses on personalized learning and direct instruction with a focus on meeting more than solely academic needs.   Personalized learning is an approach to instruction that is centered on the student. It taps into a student�s needs, strengths, and interests to engage students and to provide a �best fit� education for each student. The instruction is tailored to the individual needs of the student, and students learn in a way that best meets their learning style. Third Future's personalized learning program features four distinguishing characteristics: 1. Learner Profile is a summary of the student�s academic history, strengths, interests, social-emotional needs, and how he learns best. It is developed with the student and the parents in order to let the school know how to provide a tailored education that meets the individual student�s needs and goals. 2. Student Learning Plan is the individualized, academic plan that will enable the student to reach academic proficiency and meet his other learning goals. It outlines the part of a student�s curriculum that will be taught directly and the activities and lessons that will be customized for the student. 3. Flexible Learning Environment allows students to have a more tailored schedule and allows the teacher to use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction. Students may receive some instruction in a large group (25 students) or work in a small group, with a partner, or by himself. With the help of technology, and because the doors of the school will be open from 6:30 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., students may also learn before school, after school, or at home. 4. Competency-Based Education allows students to learn at their own pace. If a student has already mastered an objective or standard, they can move on to accelerated objectives or to a topic related to their other learning goals. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, she can take more time and received more individualized or small group instruction.   Third Future is also implements the ""dyad"" concept that establishes requirements for experiences that are often only available to students with means, such as participating in sports, learning an instrument, traveling, and more. Third Future provides these experiences to students who are not able to afford them.   Students in the upper grades at Sam Houston also take a course called The Art of Thinking. To my knowledge, Third Future Schools spend the most time on teaching critical thinking and informational literacy, which is so critical to our current society.   Finally, Sam Houston is currently open from 6:30-4:30 (and even later outside of the current pandemic), which provides families free before and after school care.

Administration, staff, and volunteers have been working tirelessly to launch the k-5 public charter school. When they realized COVID-19 was going to monumentally shift education models, they pivoted and created their COVID response plan. I3 Academy teammates consulted with local Department of Health and CDC leaders to create the i3 Safe for Me COVID-19 Response plan. The tenants of the plan include increased hygiene and social distancing measures, extreme flexibility of learning, and strong communication between the school and families. We are a couple of months into school, and our model is working. Students have adapted to wearing their face covering in-person and remote learning when not on campus. Our teachers have integrated synchronous learning with unique ideas like a remote field trip to her family�s farm and virtual letter hunts. As part of our COVID safety plan, families had the choice to decide the learning format that best serves their students. We have students fully in-person, fully remote, and hybrid with two days on campus and remote the rest of the week. None of the schools in our area offered that many learning formats or allowed families� input.   I3 Academy is built on the belief that all children can succeed in school when they are engaged in learning. The teaching model focuses on educating the whole child. Classroom teachers embed social-emotional learning into all lessons. Students, their teacher, and paraeducator meet each morning to walk through a social-emotional curriculum that emphasizes empathy, self-regulation, and other interpersonal skills. I3 Academy also has a social worker, school counselor, and community liaison on staff who ensure students are receiving the wraparound services needed to excel in the classroom. The Student Support Services team has built partnerships with various local non-profits ranging from Christ Health Center, a nearby health clinic that agrees to see i3 Academy students at low cost, to Christian Service Mission, which provided 250 Thanksgiving boxes.   I3 Academy is a diverse school with over 91% students of color. I3 Academy leadership intentionally recruited a diverse set of educators and staff. Over 55% of staff are people of color and nearly 20% of the on-campus staff are male. All staff underwent anti-racism training to begin the school year, and those conversations are on-going in the classroom and throughout the school. I3 Academy lives out our mission of empowering learners to become agents of change who solve the problems they see in their world. ",402,Anonymous

Nominator_2020-11_Arkansas Team Digital_Batesville Junior High School,Arkansas Team Digital,"  Overall, BJHS is relatively new to implementing blended learning, so for this school year, what stands out the most is the commitment to being flexible and providing multiple educational avenues for students that have allowed parents and students to select a learning environment that provides security and safety, but also provides a quality educational experience for our students. Teachers have moved to use Google Classroom as the primary interface with students. The Batesville School District has allowed students to choose between 3 different learning environments this school year, based on the parent and student preference. Most of our students are in person or remote, which for BJHS means the student is joining a physical classroom via Google Meet from an alternate location. This allows the student to take part in classroom discussions and have access ""real-time"" to a teacher but doing so from the safety of their location of choice.  As far as doing things differently, BJHS is a one to one school. All students are issued a Chromebook, and the vast majority of our curriculum is provided via a digital format. Because BJHS had chosen to go one to one a few years ago, the staff and students were already in a situation to pivot to off-site learning when COVID struck our area. Though there were issues to resolve, our district was in a strong position to roll out digital learning to students. When this school year began, all students were given 3 options regarding how they would receive their education. Students were given the option of attending in person, attend ""remotely"" (which is described above), or attending virtually.   Virtual instruction at BJHS consisted of students accessing courseware via Edgenuity or Lincoln Learning and working at their own pace.  This provided our families and students the ability to select the learning option that best suited their needs. There is no other district in our geographic area that I am aware of that provided this many students' options. ",407,Arkansas Team Digital

Nominator_2020-11_Learning Policy Institute_Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High,Learning Policy Institute,"Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School, located in Boyle Heights in East LA, is a full-service community school that places its students and their futures at the heart of its equity-oriented vision. Mendez operated as a community school long before it became one of the first members of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Community School cohort in 2019. This means that the school prioritizes the four pillars of a community school: integrated student supports (wraparound services), extended learning time and opportunity, distributed leadership, and family and community engagement. Students understand that their wellbeing is at the heart of the school's mission. In 2019, 85% of students reported feeling safe at Mendez and 81% of students reported that they are happy to be at Mendez (LAUSD School Experience Survey, 2019). At Mendez, student learning is also a priority, and the school�s graduation rates have risen dramatically in the ten years since its founding in 2009. The school began with a graduation rate of nearly 50% and now has a graduation rate of over 84%, 90% of whom go to college.  As part of the school's focus on integrated student supports, Mendez High School partners with a number of different community organizations that provide services to students and their families. These community partners fulfill different roles on campus and can engage in case management, put on whole-school events, and offer group supports. Individual case management organizations, like Promesa Boyle Heights or Communities in Schools LA, provide one-on-one supports to students and families, often targeting dropout prevention and academic engagement through mental health supports or other interventions. The school also recently broke ground on a Wellness Center, where it will be able to provide mental and physical health resources to the Boyle Heights community. This Wellness Center is the result of over 10 years of organizing by the school and its community partners.   The school also holds high academic expectations for its students and launched two initiatives that target student learning gains: AP for All and Computer Science for All. As part of these initiatives, all Mendez students take at least one AP course and at least one Computer Science course prior to graduation. Many students choose to continue taking AP and Computer Science courses once they are exposed to the experience. Teachers and parents were concerned at the outset of the AP for All initiative that students would all choose to take AP Spanish, as the student population is predominantly Latino/a/x and there is a higher proportion of English Learners at Mendez than there are across the district and statewide. And yet, students have demonstrated an interest in a variety of AP courses since the initiative began. The school also focuses on the needs of students with disabilities and uses an inclusion model to ensure that students with special needs are given the same opportunities to learn as their peers.   Mendez's principal, Mauro Bautista, models a culture of distributed leadership. This is reflected in many of the aspects of the school, including its multiple governing bodies that include a variety of stakeholders throughout the community. There is a School Site Council, Local School Leadership, the School Culture Committee, the Family Action Team, and the House of Student Representatives. Many of the initiatives that are currently central to Mendez�s approach are the result Principal Bautista seeking feedback from educators and families to guide decisions, including the school�s Restorative Justice, Computer Science for All, and AP for All initiatives, which were all started by Mendez teachers.  The school has a hands-on approach to family and community engagement, which it leveraged when the pandemic closed LAUSD schools. Mendez staff and community partners reached out to every student and family, and if they could not contact anyone they did home visits. At these home visits, they provided an array of services, including delivering food or supplies and providing mental health check-ins. They also leveraged these relationships with families to determine how to deliver instruction in the Fall of 2020. Teachers, families, and students came together over the summer to determine the master schedule in the fall. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. They began planning for hybrid learning, where students will be on-campus part-time and their instruction will be aligned across the virtual and in-person learning environments.  Being on Mendez's campus is a joyful experience. Students whom you speak with readily share their learning, parents are frequently on campus volunteering or taking classes at its Family Center, and school leaders like Principal Bautista are often wandering the halls or working in the library because they both want to be accessible to the community and because they probably gave their office away to a community partner who is visiting campus. I'm excited to nominate Mendez because it is truly a community-based initiative that puts social and racial justice at the center of its decisions, which are all in service of the bright future of its students.",409,Learning Policy Institute

Nominator_2020-11_Fielding International_Eden Park Elementary School,Fielding International,"Cranston Public Schools (CPS) is an average-sized American public school district of twenty-two schools that serve an economically and ethnically diverse population.  Cranston is the third-largest city in Rhode Island, and typical of most American cities, most of its schools were built in the 1950s and �60s. Despite the advanced age of many schools in the District, CPS leadership proclaimed that ""we must go beyond warm, safe and dry."" We had just completed a comprehensive school facility plan, reinventing and reimagining Cranston�s schools for the new twenty years and beyond. When approached by CPS District leadership to identify a potential �Pathfinder� or demonstration project, the Eden Park School presented a golden opportunity.   The School has a very progressive Principal and a teaching staff that was ready to reimagine and redefine their roles as teachers by letting go of the assumptions of what used to be school. They have fully embraced project-based learning and the five stages of finding a solution, real-time collaboration, and a flexible schedule to match their learning environments� flexibility.   Eden Park Learning Community is an ensemble of student-centered collaborative spaces. Moving away from the one teacher, one room, and sole care of one group of students, it is an environment that supports learner-agency, transparent technology, and fosters a wide variety of teaching and learning situations. These situations range from small group and independent study to whole group instruction or one-on-one with a teacher. The spaces also emphasize the importance of teacher collaboration by deprivatizing the planning process and include workspaces that allow teachers to work both independently and collaboratively.  The adoption of the Learning Community model at Eden Park has brought more flexibility and variety in day-to-day learning activities.  The old corridor was absorbed into the Learning Commons, leading to an agile space that supports multiple ways of learning, and multiple groups of learners.  This type of shared commons created a diffuse distribution of students and collaborative work areas.  Transparency between Learning Studios and the Commons facilitates interdisciplinary PBL learning for kids, adults, and folks who push-into these spaces for special services. The teachers have embraced industry experts and community partnerships in every way. Industry partners now plan with teachers, launch projects, and are utilized for feedback throughout each stage in the problem-solving process.   Teacher professional development through FI is embedded into the fabric of their work. Cranston is involved in ongoing professional development, which includes a three-year teacher coaching program. Teachers develop mastery in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum. Each year, the program becomes more student-centered, with learners identifying and defining problems and projects themselves by year three.   The results are in: at the 3rd-5th Grade Learning Community at the Eden Park School, the first completed, the level of engagement, personalization and physical comfort has reduced absences, seen a huge drop in disciplinary issues, and all but eliminated the need for specialized isolation and decompression rooms for students with special needs--instead, they are thriving within a suite of spaces shared by everyone in their learning community.

Nominator_2020-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Woodstock Union Middle/High School,Vermont Agency of Education,"The Windsor Central leadership team began the process of developing a Portrait of a Graduate and related strategic plan during the 2018-2019 school year. This effort allowed students, parents, educators, and community members in the newly formed Windsor Central Modified Unified Union District to collectively construct a vision of their graduates and a plan for enabling learners to meet those expectations. The strategic plan that was developed provides a clear roadmap with the Portrait of a Graduate being their �north star.� Leadership recognized the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in a meaningful process to achieve positive change. I was fortunate to be able to attend sessions and observe the high-level of commitment by all involved.   A systems perspective is also evident in Windsor Central�s strategic plan through intentional connections between strategies and the Portrait of a Graduate competencies. For instance, Strategy 1.2 states, �Achieve a high level of math proficiency for all students through curriculum review, classroom instructional practices, professional development, and robust interventions so that all students reach their full potential.� The related Portrait Competency, Academic Excellence, is identified in order to ensure coherence between strategies and competencies.   At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects. This �Teacher�s Toolkit� is aimed at providing strategies for fostering skills and dispositions within the PoG. It was developed by educators as a resource to bring the PoG to life in classrooms. The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  ?	Create a culture of �Deep Learning� in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; ?	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; ?	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; ?	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; ?	Develop a list of �instructional lenses�;  ?	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  ?	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpacks� tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them. Place-based learning supports the development of a sense of wonder, grows students� social-emotional skills, increases engagement, and builds a better understanding of the world.   Windsor Central Unified Union School District has engaged in racial equity work with the support of Writing Wrongs, LLC. The Windsor Central School Board�s anti-racist work is focused on creating anti-racist policy. They have received a grant to dig further into current anti-racist efforts, starting with school board members and leadership within the system. An equity audit will be used to gather data regarding the current status.   The Leadership Team commits to adopting a more visible stance of active listening, collective learning, internal reflection, and critical evaluation of current practice. This stance and any action plans will be developed with the help of partnerships with individuals and organizations centered on this work to expose systemic racism embedded in our educational system. Leadership commits to providing students with an education that is explicitly anti-racist and refuses to turn away from the hard truths of our history. ",471,Anonymous

Nominator_2020-11_UP for Learning_Winooski Middle High School,UP for Learning,"Beginning in 2011, the Winooski Schools embarked on a mission to redesign our educational program to better reflect the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. We were awarded a 6-year grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation that funded opportunities for teacher growth as innovators and leaders, one-to-one technology, and an outreach effort that extended into the community�s living rooms and conference rooms to ask �What do our students need to succeed?�  The answers to that question were distilled into our six Graduate Expectations, or GXs: Communication, Critical Thinking, Culture & Community, Creativity, Persistence, and Wellbeing. Currently, students demonstrate the first two in order to graduate, with all required by 2022. Each is assessed through a multi-stage performance-based assessment and final demonstration of learning during our Expo Weeks in January and June. Students are also assessed for graduation in 19 academic proficiency areas and through skill tests in reading and mathematics.  Our innovations include the iLab for fully personalized learning, a self-paced Math Lab for students at all levels, integration of technology in language learning, and numerous student-driven core courses. We also invest in student voice and leadership training, which is integrated with our expanded advisory curriculum. With support from the Rowland and Barr Foundations, Winooski is currently mapping and engaging with a wide variety of community-based partners to provide flexible pathways to graduation.

Nominator_2022-11_Vermont Agency of Education_Winooski Middle High School,Vermont Agency of Education,"The Winooski Middle High School (WMHS) is strengthening and innovating upon existing programming to boost its STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) access to all students. The WMHS Computer-Based Music-Making Program launched in 2021, driven by student interest. The Computer-Based Music Making Program is a class offered to students that allows them to create, record, and produce their own music or audio recordings using computer technology. Approximately 45% of WMHS students have resettled in Winooski through the refugee resettlement program. Among them, they speak around 20 languages, predominantly Swahili, Somali, French, and Nepali. For these students, music is a common language. For some Winooski students, who struggle academically, music has been an anchor, keeping them connected to the district and providing an outlet for their talent. Many students want to make music in their own languages or write songs that students can sing in class. This program has enabled students to express themselves and connect with other students, and the broader community and is an excellent way to be inclusive and provide equitable access to arts education.
 

 Additionally, Winooski’s promise to their community includes: 
 Students have voice and choice in their learning.  
 • Students are excited about the topics they are learning as they are tied to their interests and their futures. 
 • Learning is personalized and is relevant and meaningful to each student. 
 • Each student develops a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs, interests and passions. 
 • Students own their learning, are confident, and are willing to take on leadership roles.

 • Students choose how they learn and how they demonstrate their learning. 
 • Students advance at their own pace, with guidance from their advisor. 
 • Students move toward graduation as they master each topic.

Nominator_2020-11_MiCoOp_Link Learning,MiCoOp,"There are many reasons I am excited to nominate Link Learning, but the main reasons are their partnerships with schools around the state and how they use their data to improve student learning. Link Learning partners with brick and mortar schools that have exhausted their options for students who need a personalized learning plan and individual support. While most of these students are at-risk, Link Learning also serves the non-traditional learner like homeschoolers, professional high school athletes, students with unique medical conditions, youth in the justice system, and early parents. Students take just one or two courses at a time. Even though Link Learning is a virtual school, they have learning centers around the state for students to come and learn in a welcoming, supportive environment. Their partnership with the brick and mortar schools also allow their students to take seated courses.   Link Learning uses a tool to manage student engagement and progress. The program was developed in partnership with a software development company and their district, including virtual teachers. It automatically collects data from their LMS and records their staff interactions to get a whole-child view of each student. Within this system, they have the ability to see where a student falls in MTSS so they can intervene more quickly. The data is reviewed daily by teachers, weekly by learning center directors, and monthly by the quality assurance team (who support staff professional learning). Their data shows that the more intentional the teacher-student conversations, the more students are engaged, and the greater their academic achievement. These intentional conversations focus on helping students understand their role in learning, making a plan to fit education into their lives, and reflecting on their progress.   There is also a heavy focus on social-emotional learning. The school has staff specifically assigned to EL students, 13 special education staff, and social workers who work with students and staff. Relationships are built between students, staff, and parents to develop a community where they all feel they belong. Professional learning for staff includes shifting mindsets. First, they must understand that getting at-risk students to enroll is a success in itself. Once enrolled, they need to create connections and relationships so they are taught how to talk and relate to students. After relationships are built and students start engaging, they can focus conversations on learning such as time on task, number of days in class, and what they did when they were successful. The staff also works with students to help them self-regulate with the goal for them to become effective members of society. ",475,MiCoOp

Nominator_2020-11_MiCoOp_West Michigan Virtual Academy,MiCoOp,"Not many virtual schools offer a drop-in center for middle school students. West Michigan Virtual Academy (WMVA) serves middle and high school students, grades 6-12. When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around students� social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.  Their drop-in center is located at the city�s recreation center so WMVA has the ability to offer their virtual lifetime fitness classes with an in-person component. They also offer optional career field trips and guest speakers for all 300 students. Before COVID, the drop-in lab would regularly see 30-40 students who came in for assistance, many of them showing up multiple times a week.

Key points highlighted include:
1.Implementation of New Tech Network Model: The district adopted the New Tech Network whole-school model, embracing PBL from preschool through twelfth grade.
2. Partnerships and Funding: The district received intentional support from the Straight A Fund in Ohio's state biennial budget, enabling them to create customized, personalized learning experiences. Partnerships with construction and architecture firms like Skanska Megen Construction Co. Inc. and SHP helped build innovative, project-based learning spaces.
3.Student Involvement in Design Process: Students from grades 6-12 actively participated in the design process of the new buildings. The design was aligned with the educational vision, focusing on six key shifts in education and incorporating hallmarks of PBL instruction.
4.Identified Foundational Needs: Through this effort, foundational needs of students were recognized, including a desire for collaboration, a student-centric culture, engaging learning opportunities, various workshop sizes, mobility within the learning environment, active engagement, and access to technology in different forms.

The district's approach not only focused on physical infrastructural changes but also on aligning the design with the educational philosophy, ensuring that the learning spaces reflect the principles of project-based learning. The active involvement of students in the process indicates a commitment to meeting their needs and preferences.

Overall, the transformation of Winton Woods School District showcases a comprehensive effort to create an environment that supports innovative and student-focused learning experiences. In addition to the district-wide transformation, the high school campus stands out for its commitment to fostering mastery-based learning.

Nominator_2022-11_Vermont Agency of Education_White River Valley Middle School,Vermont Agency of Education,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country were forced to re-evaluate their priorities and restructure their operations to do their part in keeping students safe. For White River Valley Middle School, this meant shifting their classes from the traditional school building to a series of outdoor classrooms housed in tents across the campus and students sorted into “pods” with peers that shared similar schedules to minimize potential for cross-contamination. These were emergency measures, initially designed with only the immediate health and safety of students in mind. However, the opportunities to advance innovative educational strategies were not lost on school leadership. The shift to outdoor classrooms allowed for a flourishing of place-based curriculum, with students being encouraged to see the living world around them as a co-equal partner in their educational process. The reorganized pod structure created a new, small-group space where students could build relationships and adult mentors could give students more consistent attention.  
 

 We are moving into the endemic phase of COVID-19, and many of the emergency measures are beginning to subside. The tents that dotted the White River Valley Middle School campus are gone and students have returned to receiving instruction inside the school building, but that’s not to say things have returned to the way they were before. Students and teachers are still encouraged to look at learning with a place-based lens, students are still being taught to look at nature as a source for knowledge, and once a week students are still meeting with their pods to engage in restorative practices. In my eyes, this is the triumph of their leadership team.

WRVMS implemented  small, student negotiated learning communities they call ‘pods.’ There are 12 pods in WRVMS that meet thirty-five minutes every morning and two half days a week to work on student negotiated pod projects. Some pods ventured into the woods to build campsites; other pods learned about Vermont culture through the homemade apple cider process. Though each pod is unique, students are developing and strengthening transferable skills while boosting student agency.  Another schedule change was made to allow for student clubs to transpire during the regular school day. This schedule shift was made in response to a large number of students’ desire to participate in clubs without access to afterschool transportation. One of the student run clubs that specifically focuses on providing a safe and equitable environment is the Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) group. The GSA brings together LGBTQ+ and allied students to build community and organize around issues impacting them in their schools and communities.  ",583,Anonymous

● Emphasis on social emotional learning: Because soccer is the common language for refugee children, the soccer program serves as the vehicle through which students develop self-regulation, teamwork, leadership skills and other social-emotional competencies.
● Advisory model: To cultivate a sense of belonging, students belong to three distinct communities: a soccer team, a house (mixed ages among grades 6-12) and their own class (16 students max).

School leadership, teachers, and staff challenged students to embrace high standards for learning and college/career planning. Evidence for advancing student-centered learning can be observed with the adoption of and adaption of Marzano High Reliability Schools™ framework as a part of student, faculty and staff recognitions; using the framework indicators to empower their school teaching staff and students (Source: Marzano, R. J., Phil Warrik, and Julia A. Simms. A Handbook for High Reliability Schools: The Next Step in School Reform. Marzano Research, 2014.)  By adopting such a framework, the school has expanded the framework of standards to include competencies with performance assessments and academic skills that are transferable across content areas. Compass Academy students know exactly where they are and what they need to do next. This is an important component to enhancing supportive and inclusive culture experiences as this added “a level of fun and engagement that [the school] did not predict. It’s been an excellent investment in the human capital of Compass Academy.”  This leading indicator can be seen in action through restorative practice in the classrooms, using the “Good Things” protocol from Capturing Kids’ Hearts (Capturing Kids’ Hearts: A Three-Year Program Evaluation, 2016-17 to 2018-19, May 2020, https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED606969.pdf).

Nominator_2022-11_Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship_One World Middle School,Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship,"As a school community, One World Middle School has reimagined the learning of what education looks like in how students experience school as a whole. At the foundational core, they believe that students have the right to a quality and innovative standards-based education, the right to know and be known in a safe and welcoming environment, and the right to be acknowledged as unique individuals who learn differently. These core beliefs promote and advance equity and student-centered learning throughout the school. It is evident upon walking through the halls, the classrooms, and interacting with the students that their core beliefs live and breathe through how they view the purpose of education and the instructional core, and the structures they deem important.
 

 One World Middle School has proven that in order to have a reimagined equitable learning environment, two components must be in place: a safe learning environment and a staff that knows who the children are and their individual needs. To support this idea they have implemented practices and events such as Ambassador Day, Unit 0, and Developing the Whole Child Meeting (DWC). Ambassador Day is quite the experience as students across all grades are given the opportunity to select their mentors for the year. During this particular day, students engage in community-building activities by spending the entire day in small groups with their teacher mentor discussing their commonalities and differences and learning to embrace each other diversity and strengths. Throughout the year the mentors meet weekly to plan and conduct themed-based activities. For example, in November and December, mentor groups coordinate events and activities around gratitude and acts of kindness respectively. These student-led initiatives have taken different forms over the years from groups creating donation drives, reading to students at neighborhood elementary schools, making edible treats that are distributed to fellow peers, volunteering at Senior Health Centers to simply redesigning a classroom space. 
 

 In thinking about how to continually engage students and to make sure all learners see themselves in the curriculum, One World Middle School acknowledges and celebrates the various cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity that comprises the school community through their first unit of the year. One World Middle School in all grades and content areas uses the first unit of the year which is called Unit 0 to focus on student identity and understanding the child. In addition, there are weekly meetings programmed called Developing the Whole Child (DWC) where teacher teams create action plans for ambassadors who may need support academically, socially, or emotionally. These strategies are often grounded in the Pre-referral Intervention Manual (PRIM) or Adaptation for Adolescents with Autism and Asperger's manual (A-5) to tailor the support to effectively meet the needs of the student. The teams continually discuss the outcomes of the strategy with each other as well including the student for their input. Teams reflect on progress as they monitor the impact on student learning.  
 

 At One World it is evident that they are thoughtful about the language they use with their students and in their space. It is a common belief that the process for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that equitably supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults begins with language which is clearly intertwined in the fabric of the school. The school truly believes that the words students encounter on daily basis, they will in turn embody. Thus, students are addressed as ambassadors because they are encouraged and provided with opportunities to be agents of change. The word ambassador coincides with the school's construction as they operate under a United Nations model where ambassador voices are influential in the way the school functions and the changes that occur. An example of a system in place is the school's embassy delegates which include members from all grades that meet biweekly with the principal. These meetings range from discussing issues and making suggestions, to planning events such as LGBTQ Coming Out Day, Autism Awareness Day, or Breast Cancer Awareness Day which is driven by the consensus of the student body. These student-centered planned events foster a level of self and others. Every morning during morning assembly the school gathers together to proclaim as one voice, ""I want today to be one of the greatest days of my life"" to establish a positive feeling and tone for the day. As a mantra, to work and live by, the school leadership believes and promotes that each year they must create a learning environment and community that is more impactful than the previous year. 
 

 It is without a doubt, that the ambassador's academic outcome is at the core of One World Middle School's instructional focuses and practices. They have demonstrated that ambassadors learn best when they have an opportunity to collaborate with peers and then make their thinking visible. Practices in place to support that students constantly engage with other students start with the structure of how the room is designed. At One World all classes are designed to accommodate a variety of grouping configurations. These configurations support opportunities over the course of a lesson for ambassadors to engage in turn and share and work on group assignments as well as projects in a seamless manner. Teachers have collaborated on phased protocols to promote partner discussions. As a best practice, all classrooms are equipped with two certified teachers to ensure that on a daily basis all needs of their children are met. Teachers take a less active role in talking in the classroom being mindful of the fact that the one that is speaking, is the one doing most of the learning. Therefore, in a One World classroom ambassadors are often engaged in discussions about the planned tasks, and activities in an effort to meet the day's objective where the teachers utilize a series of questions or prompt to cognitively challenge students thinking to either spark ambassador questions or to promote metacognition. 
 

 Ambassadors making connections and providing opportunities is an extremely critical component of the school. For example, the entire student body annually engages in Science Day where ambassadors take their learning to design experiments and projects. Additionally, all students participate in a school-wide dissection that is tiered by grade to investigate the systems, and scientific benefits to society and to ponder the ethical consequences. All ambassadors in the 8th grade take high-school level courses (Living Environment, US History, English 11, Algebra). As a result, 8th graders start their high school careers a grade ahead which allows them to have access to a college course for free or graduate a year early. Students at One World have the opportunity to visit colleges they have expressed interest in that are located locally and across state lines. Some of the colleges toured include Boston College, Harvard, Yale, SUNY Oneota, Howard, and many others. From touring colleges students who have graduated have enrolled in colleges such as Boston College and other SUNY programs. Through their expeditionary trips to monumental sites in history, like Selma, Gettysburg, and The Capitol ambassadors have been able to make connections to topics discussed in their classes.
 

 Other practices that are embedded at One World include a dedicated department and common planning time for teachers to meet, plan and revise units that are tailored specifically for the students they teach. Student-initiated clubs and student electives where ambassadors get an opportunity to express their interests and preferences for electives in a series of exit interviews.",660,Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship

Nominator_2022-11_KnowledgeWorks_Batesburg-Leesville Primary School,KnowledgeWorks,"For the last 4 years, Batesburg-Leesville Elementary School has been on a journey to grow and sustain a personalized learning system. With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, choice boards, and student interests were targeted strategies. With the COVID pandemic in 2020, BLPS soon realized they would need to dig deeper into the development and implementation of learning pathways to support all learners. Concerned about learning loss when virtual school was the only option, teachers engaged in professional collaboration to address those learning gaps. Prioritizing standards in ELA and Mathematics was a first step in the construction of an equitable viable Learning Continuum, where progressions of learning and readiness assessments were developed for the standards. As teachers continued to collaborate in both grade level and vertical teams, it was clear the curriculum work they had done served a larger purpose than addressing learning gaps – it had in fact provided an opportunity to foster agency in all learners! Date tracking and goal setting soon belonged to the 4- and 5-year-old kindergartners, first and second graders, and progress monitoring and celebrations of learning soon followed, where the outcome was student ownership of the learning! Generative curriculum, where the youngest of learners bring ideas to school about what they want to learn taps into curiosity and has made room for projects that are truly learner-centered at BLPS. The school’s personalized learning footprint is strong and has informed district systems shifts across the K-12 system.",669,KnowledgeWorks

Nominator_2022-11_KnowledgeWorks_Rio Rico High School,KnowledgeWorks,"At Rio Rico High School, located in the Santa Cruz Valley Unified School District No 35, in Rio Rico, Arizona, students and staff all know how to ""REP”.  Based on the core values of Relationships, Excellence, and Pride the faculty embraces creating the best learning environments possible for their students.  Three years ago, as the school began thinking more critically about equitable outcomes for all learners, they expanded and deepened opportunities for students to own their learning.  Flexibility with time resulted in RRHS allowing students to build individualized learning schedules depending on their interests and situation. All grade levels offer three distinct options - face to face instruction, distance learning, and flex-scheduling - to provide students agency when deciding on the environment that best meets their needs. Wednesdays provide intervention and enrichment services for students and personalized professional development for staff.
 
In anticipation of transitioning to a standards-based system for reporting on learning, the principal facilitated a voluntary book study on Grading for Equity, by Joe Feldman.  Avant-garde teachers now implement more equitable grading practices to their level of comfort and understanding.  This behavior has grown the network of interested teachers and expanded the grass roots of implementation in advance of a full transition in SY24.  

Administration also emphasizes student voice.  Beyond creative student scheduling, a student senate meets regularly to offer insight and guidance on decision-making, student artwork beautifies the campus in multiple areas, and a student cheering section actively drives school spirit!  Through the combination of voice and choice, the students REP in palpable ways.
 
With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, distance/flex scheduling, SOPs, and student voice remain the primary strategies advancing the school-wide mantra ""We REP!""

Nominator_2022-11_KnowledgeWorks_Cibola High School,KnowledgeWorks,"For the past four years, Cibola High School, one of six high schools in Yuma Union High School district, has been reimagining education by putting systems in place to support learner-centered practices. Key in the shift is a focus on mastery learning and an expectation of student success – no matter what it takes. Three years ago, a small group of teachers and the principal began studying and applying standards-based grading principles. Today, over 60 percent of the staff participate. The shift has evolved into equitable systems of grading and assessment across the campus, resulting in student agency and ownership of the learning. Students know the vision is for them to attain the highest level of proficiency/mastery. If they don’t succeed on the first attempt, they’ll have choice and opportunity to reassess. The staff believes that all students can succeed, and they insist on rigor by not allowing them to fail. Students own their learning and share their data with parents in regular emails. Collaboration, project-based learning, and flexible seating environment enable learners to flourish academically. 

Developing leadership and ensuring voice are critical at Cibola. The Courtesy Corps of student leaders in each classroom greet visitors and explain the focus of the day’s learning. Administration ensures student voice shapes the school culture. For example, a student focus group will roll out the new Portrait of a Graduate to the student body and provide ideas on systems to embed the POG in Cibola daily life. Adult agency has grown from teachers learning from teachers (TLFT). Teachers lead professional learning opportunities, participate in peer-to-peer classroom observations and feedback loops, and choose their personal learning pathways to grow their practice. Leaders provide time and support for the adult learning; as a result, teachers completed 82 digital PCBL learning modules in November. The Culture and Climate at Cibola High School has purposefully shifted. Staff believes that all students can succeed, and the focus is on developing the “whole student”, with student growth being the priority.

Nominator_2022-11_KnowledgeWorks_San Luis High School,KnowledgeWorks,"San Luis High School, one of six high schools in the Yuma Union High School District, serves 2551 students in the southwestern corner of Arizona, bordering Mexico. The school’s mission states: “Challenging students to think and learn for themselves.” The staff has implemented learner-centered practices and systems to make this mission a reality. The academic program provides multiple learning pathways that enable every learner to be college, career, and community ready on a personal path.  Learners track their data and regularly set goals during time designated across the campus. All teachers offer choice through Universal Design for Learning, allowing students options in how to access, engage, and demonstrate learning. Choice boards, multiple assessment opportunities, and collaboration in small groups based on data provide a just-right learning environment. The early shifts to standards-based grading are providing an equitable system of assessment and reporting. 

Agency is a natural outcome of the options at San Luis. Besides the conventional structures such as Student Council and National Honor Society, student voice is intentionally amplified through the principal’s Student Advisory group, where students are leading a positive campus culture. Students co-created school-wide standard operating procedures for campus issues like cell phone usage, hallways, etc., to ensure a safe, productive environment. The robust Career Technical Student Organizations provide a platform for leadership growth and demonstration of personal achievement through national competitions. Four of these clubs received the 2022 Gold Chapter of Distinction award based on student performance.

Nominator_2023-11_Bluum_Alturas International Academy,Bluum,"Alturas International Academy is an innovative change for education. With a master approach to education, their students are taught in small group instruction at instructional levels. This gives students the opportunity to work with partners and collaborate at high levels using analytical and critical thinking skills. Alturas Prep will expand on an already established program that teaches self-discipline and responsibility to all students; provides a physical environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning; promotes communication and interaction in the classroom; supports an effective environment that promotes a sense of belonging and self esteem; and provides an academic environment that promotes learning and self-fulfillment.

The Alturas International Academy uses the Primary Years Program (PYP) designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) as a curriculum framework for young learners. Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to react, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment. Like all IB programs, PYP is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas. In the process, students develop critical thinking, research, self-management, communication, and social skills.

At Alturas, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six trans-disciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry are:

Who we are
Where we are in place and time
How we express ourselves
How the world works
How we organize ourselves
Sharing the planet

Units of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, information technology, science, and social studies, helping students make meaningful connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.

INQUIRY-BASED:
The Primary Years Program (PYP) is based on a commitment to inquiry-based teaching and the development of the whole child; socially, emotionally, and intellectually. A core belief is that children learn more effectively when they are actively involved in the learning process and build upon existing knowledge in real-life contexts – In other words, when learning is relevant and engaging.

MULTILINGUAL: 
Spanish is the language of instruction in our K–5 elementary school program.  We welcome students from all language backgrounds. Over 80% of our students begin with no Spanish language at home.

NURTURING ENVIRONMENT: 
Alturas' smaller class sizes ensure that the teachers and staff can focus on students’ social and emotional development in addition to their intellectual progress. From a place of safety, students are encouraged to inquire, wonder, and investigate—to lay the foundations of interculturally sensitive and inquisitive lives.

EXPERIENCED, CARING TEACHERS: 
Alturas' teachers provide opportunities for students to build meaning and refine understanding through structured inquiry. Outside the classroom, Alturas teachers are an integral part of our community.

REAL-WORLD CONNECTIONS: 
Students synthesize and showcase their learning by applying new knowledge to real-world problems and working collaboratively to find solutions.  For example, 5th-grade students work in groups to prepare an exhibition and presentation about a topic of their choice, showcasing their self-guided learning to the community.

Nominator_2023-11_New Tech Network_Owensboro Innovation Academy,New Tech Network,"Since it's implementation in 2015, Owensboro Innovation Academy (OIA)  leaders regularly attend NTN professional development trainings and workshops to continually improve their classroom instructional practices and receive coaching services and ongoing support.
The community partnerships program at OIA has created opportunities for students and community members to connect over shared projects — so much so that OIA was recognized in early 2022 by the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce and named Education & Workforce Development Institution of the Year. “OIA creates a love for knowledge and intellectual curiosity, and creates learners that contribute back to the local economy,” said Chamber President Candance Brake. “The community partnerships with OIA also help many people in these companies rediscover their passion. Working with young people is where you find relevance in your work for the next generation. They spark a passion that always ignited us, and help businesses reconnect with that.”
Brake also states that the students benefit from the networking aspect inherent in community partnerships. “Students will develop pathways to careers locally, and get people to become their champions — people that will help them access college, internships and eventually, a career, if they build and maintain those connections.”
At OIA, those partnerships are an essential piece to students’ college and career readiness skills, valued so highly that school leadership lobbied the district to provide a part-time staff position to manage and grow community partnerships.  
“I was handling the curriculum and the duties that come with being principal, but I knew this piece was so important. We needed dedicated resources.” The school’s community partnerships liaison splits time between teaching special education and managing community relationships for OIA; many, who Benjamin cites, return each year to collaborate on projects. “We were fortunate to have a community that bought in from the very beginning, and now, they have someone they can contact, and say, ‘we want to get on board’.”
OIA’s successful community partnerships program includes the local headquarters of businesses like Southern Star Pipeline (who provide volunteer judges and help with the school’s robotics tournaments), Puzzle Pieces, a nonprofit dedicated to helping children and adults with disabilities (where students have donated 3D puzzles they’ve created for clients) and the Chamber of Commerce that connects students with business leaders in the area. 
The sustainable structure of OIA’s project-based learning academy is a result of years of hard work, dedicated leaders and community partners, and a commitment to working through a process that provides the best outcomes for its students. “You can’t just copy [a model] and think it’s going to work,” said Benjamin. “You have to work through the process. And we wouldn’t be where we are today without our community, and those relationships, along with our curriculum and the rigor that’s part of that. New Tech Network is definitely the one to credit for that.”

Part of our Agriculture curriculum is “Food Science” in Strand 7 where “learners apply principles of biology, chemistry, and physics to the research, development, production, processing, and distribution of food products meeting quality assurance standards in a system that is safe and secure.” One avenue Aiken teachers take to address this standard is with La

Nominator_2023-11_Education Evolving_Durango Transitional Learning Center,Education Evolving,"Durango's existence is already reimagining education. It is a unique relationship between the Maricopa County Juvenile Probation Department and the Maricopa County School Superintendent aiming to provide hope and support to our most vulnerable students. The Dentation education space allows a unique setting which enables teachers to embrace more autonomy and teach with more creativity. It might seem odd that a teacher would have to enter the most structured place to break free of the traditional systems that hold them back, but the traditional school system has already failed our students; it’s time for something innovative.

Part of Durango's innovation is around their transparency. Durango works with many operational parters daily, and they have been working as a team to embrace transparency among the groups that are involved in student learning - the detention staff and the school staff. Part of that work is fine tuning meeting structures and how to report out information to everyone. Durango utilizes a collaborative teaching staff whom are able to creatively address the schools issues. For example, they were able to meet students desires around podcasts/music learning - all under the constraints of being in a detention center.  ",935,Anonymous
