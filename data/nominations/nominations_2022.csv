A for Arizona,559,Holladay Fine Arts Magnet,Tucson,Arizona,,"Holiday Fine Arts Magnet is reimagining where, when and how learning takes place by partnering with local churches and faith leaders in the community to address reading deficits with their learners.

This innovative collaboration creates new reading hubs in partnership with local church and faith leaders to better collectively tackle reading deficits through one-on-one and small group tutoring and reading intervention experiences ensuring learning happens both at school and at partner local churches and places of worship. Holladay's approach honors parents as ""first"" teachers, brings in the community, and creates wrap-around services and support for learners with the greatest academic needs as a result of COVID-19. This collaboration will create a collective circle of support focused on facilitating a shared commitment to academic success, bringing together school staff, families, learners, and faith communities as partners. The Holiday team has unskilled church volunteers on best reading approaches and how to monitor students' growth. Phase One includes reading hubs at five local churches with the intent of expanding to 15 other churches and places of worship of diverse denominations who have shown interest in participating, recognizing learners are all better if we work together. Holiday aims to facilitate a shared and inclusive commitment to academic success among learners, families, and local faith leaders."

Besides a different schedule than the traditional buildings, the difference at Turrill is the intersessions that take place during their breaks in October, February, and March. Each intercession has a theme, is taught by a lead teacher/coordinator, and has an affordable tuition rate for the week. Scholarships may be available for those who cannot afford tuition.

After a 10-15 minute morning meeting where all gather, students go to their homeroom. Students move during the day based on assessment data in reading and math. For example, a ""first-grade"" student performing above grade level in reading will attend the ""second-grade"" teacher's reading class while a ""third-grader"" needing more time to develop foundational math skills will attend a ""second-grade"" math class. Students move along the scope and sequence continuum in these subjects without being held back or forced to move forward because of their traditional grade level. 

All students receive whole group and small group instruction from their teachers. Instruction in core subjects other than reading and math is received from their homeroom teacher and students still participate in elective courses like physical education and art. While technology is used in the classroom as a resource and for supplementary activities, students spend most of their time physically with their teachers. Place-based learning opportunities are embedded into the CLK Engage program through local field trips and “Fun Friday” activities. 

While the demographics for most of the students are similar, every student is on a different learning journey. CLK Engage is addressing the individual learning paths for all students, helping them to reach their highest potential."

Office of Innovation for Education in Arkansas,547,Rogers New Technology High School,Rogers,Arkansas,N/A,"Rogers New Technology High School (RNTHS) views their learners as school and community leaders, co-designers, and partners in ""school"".

Through this personal connection, learners are more engaged, have more autonomy and personal and collective agency, are motivated, and help design learning and how they demonstrate learning. RNTHS also uses standards-based grading and focuses on student learning outcomes that target the whole person and deeper learning skills such as collaboration and critical thinking.
The goal of RNTHS is to create a partnership between student learners and adult learners. Adult learners are the facilitators (teachers) who partner with students to help them understand the content and help student learners find personal relevance in their work. They achieve this goal through project-based instructional practices which allows student voice and choice, internships which allow students to learn in their communities, and student leadership which has created service projects throughout their community to guide their purpose. Rogers New Technology High School is built on a culture of transparency and constant feedback loops to improve every day.
