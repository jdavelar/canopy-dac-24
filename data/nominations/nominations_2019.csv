Students in every classroom (1) analyze their formative assessment data to determine what to work on, (2) set short-term goals to prioritize their work, (3) choose the resources and activities they use for learning, and (4) use formative assessments to determine when they're ready to move forward.  What stands out about this school's model is that students don't just make a few arbitrary choices, but exercise real agency in all of the meaningful aspects of their learning from start to finish.  Teachers have truly shifted their roles from telling students what to learn and how to learn it, to helping students drive their own learning.  Finally, the school has made rapid progress in implementing their model by setting consistent expectations for all teachers and providing school-wide professional development.

Over the past three years, Central has implemented a school-wide blended learning approach to their teaching and learning.

There are three components that drive the work at Central;  data-driven instruction, differentiation, and school culture,   Data-driven Instruction: Every teacher has been trained in and uses formative assessment to develop their lessons.  Teachers use a family of measures to guide their instructions: such-as exit tickets, anecdotal evidence, and student work samples.   Differentiation:  Teachers use a flexible grouping process determined by student classroom data to differentiate the learning environment for their students.  Station rotations allow students to personalize their learning and have a choice in the pace of their learning.  These stations are teacher-led, student-led, and include independent learning opportunities, affording students multiple pathways for success.  They meet as a whole group for broad concept instruction, in small group with the teacher or 1:1 with support personnel for more intensive instruction, and work independently applying their learning.  School Culture: The culture of Central Elementary is purposefully designed and developed by a team of teachers, the school psychologist, and the principal.

115,126,Nominated,Lincoln Middle School,Berwyn,Illinois,none provided,No,Illinois State Board of Education,"In the fall of 2012, Berwyn North School District 98 schools were the lowest-performing schools among all those that fed into Morton West High School. District leaders set out to transform teaching and learning through culturally responsive practices to better engage their students, of whom 30 percent are English Learners and 90 percent are students of color. Berwyn North's Lincoln Middle School is now in the top 10 percent of all Illinois schools.       Berwyn North conducted both internal and external audits with all administrative, teaching, and support staff and with Berwyn families and community leaders to better understand their formative contexts and identify needs. The resulting professional development focused on five inclusive behaviors and how to integrate these behaviors into the classroom, including: how to give and receive feedback, how to be an advocate, how to make mutual contact, ways to value difference, and how to recognize underrepresentation. The entire staff participated in a book study of Zaretta Hammond's Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain.      The district developed a new, culturally responsive curriculum for all students through a teacher-driven process of deep alignment and shared assessments. Culturally responsive curriculum development means not only focusing on what is being taught, but how it is being taught to diverse learners, along with a deep analysis of why. Teams working on the curriculum included teachers and staff from every program, representing all student groups for equitable instruction. The district began working on a microcredential program in cultural responsiveness to track progress.    Page Break    Berwyn North developed a dual language program aligned to integrated English and Spanish language arts standards. Every student in Berwyn learns to read and write in one bilingual setting with all components presented in Spanish and English, with accommodations for special education students.

121,126,Nominated,Manual Academy,Peoria,Illinois,none provided,No,Illinois State Board of Education,"Visitors walking around Manual Academy's campus on the south end of Peoria School District 150 may see a few identical, carefully built wooden Adirondack chairs. These chairs are the proud handiwork of Manual Academy students and one example of the school project- and competency-based approach to education. Peoria School District 150 is part of Illinois' competency-based education pilot program. Manual Academy teachers and leaders have found that competency-based education allows students to take greater advantage of partnerships and opportunities with local businesses.       Global manufacturing giant Caterpillar is headquartered in Peoria and is one of the region's largest employers. Formerly a technical high school, Manual Academy partners with Caterpillar to prepare students for careers in manufacturing technologies. Caterpillar provides donated supplies, volunteer mentorships, a welding camp, and a $300,000 grant to support a full manufacturing curriculum co-taught at Manual Academy and Peoria's Caterpillar plant. Competency-based education also paved the way for innovative programs like Fuse Studio, a hands-on engineering lab where students choose their own projects.      Students in the Caterpillar Hiring Innovation Program learn academic concepts through hands-on experiences from painting to assembly and the most popular applied skill, welding. Students learning welding are positioned to have the skills to achieve American Welding Society certification before graduation. Engineering and industrial technology teachers spend one day a week with students and mentors at Caterpillar to supervise and track student learning goals. They track student communication and collaboration alongside trade skill milestones. The curriculum concludes with a direct pathway to real manufacturing jobs with Caterpillar upon completion. Other students go on to college with increased social-emotional skills, confidence, and direction.

146,66,Nominated,NYC iSchool,New York,New York,New York City Department of Education,No,"Mastery Collaborative, NYC Department of Education","The iSchool's instructional model has several underlying ideas:  Innovation: the need to constantly ask ""why?"" and ""what if?"" to avoid recreating the status quo; Individualization and Personalization: the focus on meeting the needs of each and every student;  Metacognitive Skill Development: the understanding that high school could no longer be about learning a defined set of concepts - that high school for the 21st century needed to emphasize the learning process and thinking skills.  In service of its core values of innovation, individualization and personalization, and metacognitive skill development, and with the reality of the system and the unique needs of adolescents in mind, the leaders developed a four-prong model:  1.     Challenge-based modules 2.     Online learning 3.     Advisory 4.     Core Experiences  Supporting these four instructional approaches are three important systems: student scheduling, individual student mastery tracking, and the school's Area of Focus program. In its entirety, this model allows the school to meet system and accountability requirements, to support students' developmental needs, to prepare students to get into and be successful in college, as well as to provide them with an important foundation for career achievement.  It is famously true that no two students at the iSchool end up with the same courses on their transcripts, because personalization is an active value, and students are encouraged to develop and follow their interests.  The iSchool's unique brand of mastery-based learning, project-based learning, and personalization is also underpinned by a belief that the most powerful way to work with young people is to give them lots of meaningful choices, and lots of responsibility. iSchool students are typically deep thinking, autonomous learners.",,,Mature and going strong (more than 3 years),,1,1,1,,1,1,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,Personalization Agency,,,360007706065,NY-310200010000-310200011376,http://www.nycischool.org,Regular School,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,9,12,High,449,2,0.45%,34,7.57%,132,29.40%,83,18.49%,164,36.53%,33,7.35%,1,0.22%,449,Yes participating without using any Provision or the CEO,Urban,"City, Large",168,37.4%,,,Not a Title I school,,,

It serves and admits students from both high-income and extremely low-income backgrounds.   RMSEL is a K-12 environment serving approximately 480 learners all on one campus. The lower school has separate K and 1st grade classrooms, and has multi-aged classrooms after that in which learners stay with crew leaders for 2 years. The middle school program has 6th as stand-alone and mixed 7/8 classrooms. In the high school, crews are mixed age with Advisors that stay with them for 4 years.   The school is an exemplar of expeditionary learning and is one of a handful of schools in the country that can still use that designation. In addition to interdisciplinary expeditions, ELA and math, the curriculum comprises an Adventure curriculum, which aligns with Kurt Hahn's original vision of allowing human beings to learn about themselves in nature. The school embraces the importance of and tracks learners against academic, socio-emotional and character values. Service and regular expeditions into the world outside school to learn are a core part of the program.  Another highlights of the is its Passages process in 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th graders. Learners present their learning, growth and personal development to volunteer adults from the wider community through portfolios that they have compiled over multiple years. This is in addition to regular exhibitions throughout the year.  The lower, middle and upper schools are designed differently with an eye towards the developmental needs of that age band. Relationship and learner agency are highly valued. It is great example of a school that integrates many elements into a coherent whole.  RMSEL, as a program, really reflects emerging research about the beneficial impact on human development and well-being of engagement/interaction with the natural world.

An Opportunity Culture school extends the reach of excellent teachers and their teams to more students, for more pay, within the school's recurring budget. Multi-Classroom Leadership is the foundation of an Opportunity Culture; multi-classroom leaders (MCLs) lead a small teaching team, providing instructional guidance and frequent, on-the-job development, while continuing to teach part of the time. The schools redesign schedules to provide additional school-day time for teacher planning, coaching and collaboration. MCLs typically lead the introduction of more effective curricula, instructional methods, classroom management and schoolwide culture-building. Accountable for the results of all students in the team, multi-classroom leaders earn substantial pay supplements, within the regular school budget.

Students move through their 'playlists' at their own pace, and move on only once content knowledge mastery is demonstrated.  However, progression based on competency is constrained to content and projects within a school year, that is, students advance grades, and pursue their respective courses, as an age-based cohort.  For content learning, students decide when they're ready to take assessments, receive immediate feedback, and can review materials or practice to incorporate the feedback, and then re-assess when they're ready.  During project time too, teachers check in with students to give feedback as needed. Learner autonomy and agency are a priority in Summit schools.  Students have a fair amount of independent control over their learning time in school, and are scaffolded in this self-regulation through check-ins with teachers and their mentor.
