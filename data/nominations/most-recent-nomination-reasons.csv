Multi-Classroom Leadership is the foundation of an Opportunity Culture; multi-classroom leaders (MCLs) lead a small teaching team, providing instructional guidance and frequent, on-the-job development, while continuing to teach part of the time. The schools redesign schedules to provide additional school-day time for teacher planning, coaching and collaboration. MCLs typically lead the introduction of more effective curricula, instructional methods, classroom management and schoolwide culture-building.

What stands out about this school's model is that students don't just make a few arbitrary choices, but exercise real agency in all of the meaningful aspects of their learning from start to finish.  Teachers have truly shifted their roles from telling students what to learn and how to learn it, to helping students drive their own learning.  Finally, the school has made rapid progress in implementing their model by setting consistent expectations for all teachers and providing school-wide professional development.

"Education Evolving",24,2021,"Mission and Vision: Boston Day and Evening Academy re-engages off-track students in their education preparing them for high school graduation, post-secondary success and meaningful participation in their community. Boston Day and Evening Academy will continue to be an innovative leader in student-centered education for off-track learners. Highlights: Competency Based Education-  The primary--and the crucial difference between a competency-based system of teaching and assessment and a traditional model, is that students begin a learning pathway (traditionally referred to as middle school or high school) based on assessed skill level in each content area, and not on arbitrary placement in grades (based on age). Each content area (i.e. Humanities, Math, Science, Technology) is divided into modules, which correspond to an academic semester, quarter, or trimester (see ROADMAP). After being assessed for their knowledge in each content area, students are placed into the module which puts them at their """"learning edge"""" i.e. challenging, but not overwhelming. Students progress from module to module in each content area, based on their ability to demonstrate mastery in each area, independently and multiple times. Once they meet the assigned benchmarks in each module, they become """"competent"""", and move on to the next module. If they finish a trimester without demonstrating competency in an area, they repeat that module--and that module only--while moving ahead in other content areas. Innovative Teaching Practices In addition to using competency-based teaching and assessment practices to drive the curriculum and inform the learning that takes place at BDEA, faculty are constantly embracing new forms of teaching that address the student-centered nature of their work. Blended Learning- We are thoughtful about how we are using technology to enhance learning, and hear from students that they need a balance of technology and personalized, teacher-led instruction.  Our approach has been to create a blended learning model that combines a variety of options including online courses, as well as technology-supported classes enhanced by the use of iPads, Smartboards and computers.  We have a Personalized Online Learning Lab (POLL) where students can catch up on classroom work or accelerate their progress through classes. But the bottom line is always having teachers available for support, direction, and conversation. Experiential Learning- For over a decade, BDEA has included Project Month as a way of turning all classes """"experiential"""", and giving students--and teachers--an opportunity to collaborate on projects that become an enduring part of the whole-school community.  One year, one of the projects turned an abandoned community clubhouse into a solar powered, hydroponic greenhouse. Another year, students engaged with the """"Occupy Boston"""" movement and recreated the experience of tent living, media coverage, and the genesis of the Arab Spring in a series of connecting classrooms at the school.   Active Learning- Active Learning takes many forms, from the expected inclusion of physical fitness into the everyday experience of our staff and students, to the authentic learning experience that results from theatrical movement classes taught by valued partners Actors' Shakespeare Project.   Our partners at Project Adventure helped us to understand and incorporate important aspects of """"active"""" learning into our teaching practice, coaching students to physically """"move through"""" diagrams  instead of writing them on a whiteboard, and to use space rather than fill it."

Over the past three years, Central has implemented a school-wide blended learning approach to their teaching and learning. Focusing on a station rotation model in grades K-3 and mixture of a flex/station model in grades 4-5.  There are three components that drive the work at Central;  data-driven instruction, differentiation, and school culture,   Data-driven Instruction: Every teacher has been trained in and uses formative assessment to develop their lessons.  Teachers use a family of measures to guide their instructions: such-as exit tickets, anecdotal evidence, and student work samples.   Differentiation:  Teachers use a flexible grouping process determined by student classroom data to differentiate the learning environment for their students.  Station rotations allow students to personalize their learning and have a choice in the pace of their learning.  These stations are teacher-led, student-led, and include independent learning opportunities, affording students multiple pathways for success.  They meet as a whole group for broad concept instruction, in small group with the teacher or 1:1 with support personnel for more intensive instruction, and work independently applying their learning.  School Culture: The culture of Central Elementary is purposefully designed and developed by a team of teachers, the school psychologist, and the principal.

Students (1) use their assessment data to determine which standard to work on, (2) set a short-term goal to master the standard, (3) select the resources, activities and people they think will best help them reach mastery, and (4) use formative assessments to determine when move on.

They are very articulate on how they have worked with the staff to co-develop this model, across three cohorts of teachers. Colleen Collins gave us an important lesson from her work there as principal: """"everyone needs to feel that they're part of the pilot."""" Meaning: initially the school worked deeply with its first cohort to co-develop the model, and then did the same with the second cohort; when it came time to bring the third cohort into the work, those teachers were told to watch the other cohorts and """"do what they do."""" That strategy produced some pushback from those teachers and convinced Colleen and other school leaders that in fact, it is crucial in designing and implementing agency-driven learning models to make sure that the adults are all experiencing the same kind of agency-driven culture. Later cohorts of teachers can't simply be asked to implement; they must be invited to co-create as much as earlier cohorts, even as they also are able to build on the work of those cohorts. This is a crucial lesson for the field. The change processes and the professional culture of teachers must mirror the 21st-century goals and learning strategies that we are all holding for students."

The school was designed by a team of teachers, who are the co-founders and current lead collaborators of the school. The objective was to create a school that serves a population that is representative of Greeley with demographics to match that of the community. The current student population is 50.8 % white and 49.1% Hispanic or multiple races, with 49% of the population receiving free or reduced lunch. Designed based on the belief that children are naturally curious and creative learners, the school's mission is to foster an atmosphere that encourages risk-taking and curiosity so that students are empowered to become problem-finders and problem-solvers. One of the hallmarks of FTSOI is the fidelity to its design foundations (mission, instructional vision, core values, and design priorities). The design foundations are not just a series of statements, but rather serve as the foundation for decisions and structures throughout the school and are evident in their daily practice. This leads to a school that iterates on the execution of this design, but still maintains a strong identity grounded in its founding principles. Students explore theme-based topics (loops), with cross-content connections that ask them to learn about topics and concepts in greater depth, in grade level bands. Ingrained in the heart of the school's culture is openness to failure and trying again. The goal is to make failure feel safe so that students aren't afraid to try new things. Additionally, teacher and leadership roles have been reimagined at this school. Teachers are known as Band Collaborators and generally teach two grade levels of students within their band.

Brooks is one of 11 schools in Chicago Public Schools participating in Illinois' competency-based education pilot program. In competency-based learning, educators assess and advance students based on demonstrated mastery of specific skills, abilities, and knowledge.       

Brooks Principal Shannae Jackson and her staff created rubrics detailing the learning standards and what mastery of each standard looks like. The rubrics express clear expectations for each performance or project, which helps students self-assess their path forward for improving and/or progressing to the next unit. Students can work at their own pace without feeling left behind or waiting for the rest of the class. Students receive scores on a scale of 0 to 4. A 4 reflects exceeding mastery of the standard, a three reflects mastery, a 2 reflects a minor conceptual error, a 1 reflects a major conceptual error, and a 0 reflects no attempt at the standard or an attempt unrelated to the content. Students receive letter grades based on the percentage of standards met.      

""""Students are starting to talk about needing to demonstrate mastery,"""" said Principal Jackson. """"They'll say, 'This is exactly what I need to do. This is exactly the learning target or standard I have not demonstrated mastery in so I need to do more practice work or go into tutoring.' They can articulate those things clearly. You can hear the language change in the hallways. They're like, 'I'm going in for the retake for the formative. Have you reached mastery yet?'

There is a student lounge with a maker space, therapy dogs, and a weight room where students can go to relieve stress. They also have the ability to leave class with no questions asked. The school staff believe that de-escalation must occur before issues can be addressed. School suspensions are spent in a separate room in the building where students can complete their work. Students can bring their babies to school and have been known to address the entire student body about LGBTQ and BLM issues. Students have access to a food pantry which also contains personal items and clothing. The staff and students at Horizons feel safe, accepted, have a sense of belonging, and are responsible for themselves and others.  Academically, students can move on when ready and they have the option to take project-based courses.

Within each of these domains they have identified large areas of competency, each of which is broken down into progressions. Each learner that comes in is asked to go through about 4 weeks of getting to know themselves with a battery of assessments - personality, cognitive strengths, etc. while the school connects with past environments to get a sense of their history. The team of educators with the learner and any guardian that might exist then crafts an """"Urgency Story"""" that becomes the starting place for the work, support and opportunities that learner gets. However, Norris is unflinching in its commitment to Wellness first, believing that until a human being is well they will not progress significantly or sustainably in the other domains."

"Mastery Collaborative, NYC Department of Education",146,2019,"The iSchool's instructional model has several underlying ideas:  Innovation: the need to constantly ask """"why?"""" and """"what if?"""" to avoid recreating the status quo; Individualization and Personalization: the focus on meeting the needs of each and every student;  Metacognitive Skill Development: the understanding that high school could no longer be about learning a defined set of concepts - that high school for the 21st century needed to emphasize the learning process and thinking skills.  In service of its core values of innovation, individualization and personalization, and metacognitive skill development, and with the reality of the system and the unique needs of adolescents in mind, the leaders developed a four-prong model:  1.     Challenge-based modules 2.     Online learning 3.     Advisory 4.     Core Experiences  Supporting these four instructional approaches are three important systems: student scheduling, individual student mastery tracking, and the school's Area of Focus program. In its entirety, this model allows the school to meet system and accountability requirements, to support students' developmental needs, to prepare students to get into and be successful in college, as well as to provide them with an important foundation for career achievement.  It is famously true that no two students at the iSchool end up with the same courses on their transcripts, because personalization is an active value, and students are encouraged to develop and follow their interests.  The iSchool's unique brand of mastery-based learning, project-based learning, and personalization is also underpinned by a belief that the most powerful way to work with young people is to give them lots of meaningful choices, and lots of responsibility. iSchool students are typically deep thinking, autonomous learners."

School and district leaders intentionally thought about course offerings, quality of different pathways, and students' access to those pathways, resulting in news programs in mechatronics and other career and technical fields in addition to traditional college-preparatory offerings. As school and district leaders built pathways for 2200 diverse students from families with different post-secondary education experiences, school and district leaders realized that students needed different supports to navigating the school's options. One such support is providing intentional advising support for each of its approximately 2200 students. All four counselors meet with each of their nearly 600 incoming freshmen each year to discuss their plans for high school and beyond. Each counselor follows their group of students over their four years of high school, ensuring the person responsible for supporting students knows each student and supports them toward the path that best fits the student. This continuity of care throughout the high school years is a critical aspect of ensuring students have a wide range of meaningful college and career choices. "

Reiche is located near a large refugee processing and over 40% of their students are ESL, and of those over 40% are IELD. Reiche has over 40 languages spoken at their school and a high rate of poverty with 78% FRL.   Reiche was Maine's first """"failing"""" school. A progressive principal assigned to the school built leadership capacity and a highly collaborative culture among the staff. When the principal was reassigned, the Reiche teacher team worked with their union local to negotiate with their superintendent to assign an interim principal while they entered a year of exploration.   The team voted to convert to teacher-powered in 2011, something collaborative teams across the nation are beginning to explore. Today, the team selects three lead teachers on a rotating basis (each lead teacher serving four years) and every teacher participates in school-level decision-making.  With interest in opening the opportunity for other groups of teachers to replicate Reiche's model, the Maine legislature in 2013 passed, """"An Act to Develop a Grant Program to Establish a Teacher-led School Model."""" This Bill encourages teacher-powered schools by allowing schools or districts to apply for grant monies to explore, develop and implement alternative governance structures.  Under the teacher team's leadership, they have turned around their status as Maine's first failing school and are now a model for success. Reiche has found that if students stay at their school over 3 years (mobility is certainly an issue with their population) then proficiency rates start to dramatically rise.  The teacher team has decided to use a community school model to serve the many needs of their students and families. This means that they partner with local organizations to provide services to their students and families, for example, the Opportunity Alliance in Portland which provides children and adults with mental health services.

It serves and admits students from both high-income and extremely low-income backgrounds.   RMSEL is a K-12 environment serving approximately 480 learners all on one campus. The lower school has separate K and 1st grade classrooms, and has multi-aged classrooms after that in which learners stay with crew leaders for 2 years. The middle school program has 6th as stand-alone and mixed 7/8 classrooms. In the high school, crews are mixed age with Advisors that stay with them for 4 years.   The school is an exemplar of expeditionary learning and is one of a handful of schools in the country that can still use that designation. In addition to interdisciplinary expeditions, ELA and math, the curriculum comprises an Adventure curriculum, which aligns with Kurt Hahn's original vision of allowing human beings to learn about themselves in nature. The school embraces the importance of and tracks learners against academic, socio-emotional and character values. Service and regular expeditions into the world outside school to learn are a core part of the program.  Another highlights of the is its Passages process in 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th graders. Learners present their learning, growth and personal development to volunteer adults from the wider community through portfolios that they have compiled over multiple years.

Prior to the start of this innovation, Shawnee Public Schools staff members, students, and their families faced many challenges when trying to take care of health issues during the school day, including lost wages for parents and loss of instructional time for students. Staff and students who became sick while at school often could not be seen by a healthcare provider immediately, if at all. Beginning in 2018, Shawnee Public Schools partnered with the Team Clinics program to overcome these obstacles. With this partnership, Shawnee students and staff with health issues may go to the nurse's office and have a virtual doctor visit. In these virtual visits, the nurse connects online with a provider and, with special computer-connected equipment, the provider can check ears, noses, throats, lung sounds, and heartbeats. Often times, the patient receives a diagnosis and is treated within an hour or less. If the patient requires medication, the provider calls it into the pharmacy of the parent's choice.  Since the Team Clinic program began in September 2018, more than 110 students and staff have visited the virtual clinics.

For content learning, students decide when they're ready to take assessments, receive immediate feedback, and can review materials or practice to incorporate the feedback, and then re-assess when they're ready.  During project time too, teachers check in with students to give feedback as needed. Learner autonomy and agency are a priority in Summit schools.

FLEX time is a challenge and support block developed by WWUES teachers. FLEX time provides students with a menu of options to select from that are both teacher and student directed. Choice is a key element of the design and student-engaged assessment practices drive a self-directed model of challenge and support within this innovative model. Two years after this teacher-led innovation was developed, Farmington is implementing this design across K-8 schools. Clear standards and data driven decision-making are a key feature of WWUES' student-centered approach. All standards for the week are clearly articulated and the student work from the week provides the body of evidence that demonstrates student progress towards those standards. While many of the offerings are based on academic standards, they are not exclusively so. Sessions can focus on learner mindset, Vision of the Graduate skills, organization, or any other social/emotional or executive functioning skills that teachers identify as an area of need. Student self-reflection, voice and choice is key to this daily block. Students are given tools and feedback to assess their own strengths and needs and are trusted to make wise choices about how to most effectively make use of the time and support they are provided. Students who have met the standards are given the opportunity to exceed the standard by working on the standard at a more advanced level. WWUES implements a mastery-based approach to empower students as leaders of their own learning. Farmington's mastery-based principles are implemented in all classrooms. "
"Illinois State Board of Education",225,2019,"Dr. Lazaro Lopez, then principal of Wheeling High School, met with manufacturers, business leaders and the local department of economic development in 2007 to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region needed to meet workforce demand. That partnership gave birth to the Township High School District 214 Career Pathways program. District 214 prepares its students for college and careers through experiential learning in 16 career clusters and 44 career pathways. The Career Pathways program currently serves more than 12,000 students from six comprehensive high schools, including Wheeling High School, and four specialized learning programs. District 214 purposefully eliminated the distinction between core courses and technical and career education courses. As many as 85 percent of District 214's students graduate having taken a college course, and two-thirds have completed nine semester hours of college credit by the time they graduate, an opportunity for considerable savings in tuition costs. Ninety-five percent of the district's students identify a career area of interest by graduation. Students have logged more than 2 million hours of workplace learning. The Educator Prep career pathway has served as a statewide model for addressing the teacher shortage. The teaching cluster begins with a sequence of high school courses that provide students an early feel for education as a career. Students who continue with the program earn early college credits and spend several days a week teaching lessons in actual K-12 classrooms under the close supervision of a master teacher. Students then can continue in the Educator Prep program with a postsecondary partner and earn a bachelor's degree and a teaching license. The district provides a network of supports for students while in college to increase the likelihood they graduate and become teachers. The district guarantees each student first access to interview for district teaching jobs. "

"Education Reimagined",266,2021,"Founded on the integration of community into every learning opportunity young people encounter, this learning environment is a one-of-a-kind model that takes advantage of both the learning spaces that already exist in the community and the opportunity to build out new ones that will give back to the community served.  Embark's primary learning spaces currently include a learning hub, a coffee shop, and a bike shopâ€”all of which exist solely for the purpose of serving Embark's young learners. This socially embedded, open-walled design naturally challenges young people to continuously push beyond their social and emotional comfort zones. Baked into every learning experience is the opportunity for the learner to reflect on their successes and failuresâ€”resulting in an ever-evolving understanding of their sense of self.  Developing a sense of self is a primary learning outcome at Embark. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized experiences, this outcome is achieved with remarkable consistency. Take one young learner who was learning at Embark's coffee shop, Pinwheel Coffee.  One day, she became particularly curious about the espresso machineâ€”its inner workings and what made espresso so appealing to the shop's customers. Questions began flying left and right in her mind: â€œHow does this espresso machine work? How profitable is a single espresso drink? What do we charge for an espresso? Why do we charge that much? Should we charge that much? Should we charge more or less? Where do our coffee beans come from? Who is our source?â€  Rather than having to let these questions go unanswered, Embark's learner-centered environment provides the space and opportunity for a rich and robust exploration to unfold. The young learner sat down with a mentor and reviewed the coffee shop's financialsâ€”developing an understanding of the cost and revenue of each espresso order. Then, she was able to contact the vendors who supplied the coffee beans to better understand how they were sourced. Shortly after her research concluded, the coffee shop did adjust their prices, citing her work as a contributing factor to the changes made.  So, through one unimpeded and wide-ranging learning experience, she was able to dig into business finance, business ethics, local and international trade, and supply chain management. Whereas a conventional setting might allow her to touch on a few of these topics in isolated, time-restricted units, this young learner dove right into the complexity and overlap of each topic within a real business settingâ€”guided by her own burgeoning learner agency.  Embark's focus on letting young learners lead the way requires adult leaders to be ready at a moment's notice to support the growth and development of new learning journeys no matter how unexpected they might be. And, it is the unexpected that keeps everyone passionately engaged in their work, ready to discover what each new day has to offer."

"Idaho STEM Action Center",274,2021,"There are two particularly notable characteristics that make Galileo STEM Academy an outstanding school.

The second graders are the ones who run the monthly store which includes, but is not limited to, budgeting, handling all transactions, calculating net and gross profit, advertising, and evaluating business plans from other students. The level of autonomy afforded the students is remarkable and keeps them highly engaged as active learners. This leads to the second trait. The students are almost continually engaged in cross-discipline, project-based learning. At Galileo, everything starts with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and then subjects are integrated into the project along with the corresponding standards. They routinely utilize the engineering design process as they seek to solve real world problems, primarily of their own choosing.

Instead, a competency-based culture of collaboration, community, and curiosity were going to drive the learning for each individual child.  The leaders at Highlands Micro School never asked if kids as young as four and five could develop a sense of learner agency. They knew it to be true based on the scientific evidence they had gathered, and they set out to prove the findings. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized learning, they have rewritten the story on what learners are capable of. There is no greater example than the young girl who proclaimed, â€œDandelions are the cure for cancer!â€  Rather than thinking, â€œthat's nice, honey,â€ her scientifically-minded mother and educators challenged her to prove it. And, off she went exploring scientific literature, utilizing her strengths as a writer, and creating a presentation for her community to assess her findings. Oh, by the way, this learner was five years old! And, she's one of many stories coming out of this socially embedded environment where every learner supports one another as they pursue their annual passion projects.  With an assessment framework that all but eliminates the ability to compare, learners aren't looking to compete with one another. They want to see everyone succeed and grow. Each learner is on a path to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that support their present and future yearnings, which are unimpeded by the individual interests of their peers.

A partnership with CASA de Maryland provides students with a range of social, health, legal and educational services while content-focused partnerships such as one with I Learn America, help students tell their unique stories of resilience. Others leverage student' existing interests such as their partnership with Soccer Without Borders and World Lens Foundation, which focuses on photography. An expansive college partnership network allows the school to operate an informal cohort structure in which multiple IHSLP students attend the same colleges and universities. These IHSLP graduates form support groups on their campuses, helping each other navigate college life. This is part of the school's strong college-going culture, which includes two counselors, two social workers, a pupil caseworker and a parent outreach caseworker who also works with students during the school day. Over 95% of the school's inaugural class graduated."

"Education Reimagined",293,2021,"Learners at Iowa BIG generate new innovations, solve problems for their neighbors, and think critically about the challenges of their community. Started in 2013, this program coordinates with the area's high schools to have learners split their time between traditional classes and Iowa BIG projects. These projects originate from companies and organizations that have untapped ideas and challenges they can't resource. So, when an Iowa BIG learner takes up the challengeâ€”it's a win-win.  When working on their projects, learners come to a co-located space in downtown Cedar Rapidsâ€”putting them side by side with local entrepreneurs and million dollar companies. This co-working space has a profound effect on learners. When they're at Iowa BIG, they aren't just studentsâ€”they're inventors, creators, designers. And they know no limits.  Even when they return to their traditional high schools, their work and accomplishments follow them. Iowa BIG is a fully competency-based environment. Learners are tracked standard-by-standard as they move through their projects, ensuring the highest level of mastery.  As learners explore the possibilities of their projects, highly qualified staff record experiences and products using proprietary software to ensure progress. Rather than build a pre-fabbed curriculum, at Iowa BIG their community is their curriculum."

Using a flex-mod schedule helped the school implement a scheduling system that teachers utilized to flex students into their classes or flex their advisory students to classes where additional help was needed. Advisory time is an important part of MHS plan. Teachers are assigned 12-15 students. During this time teachers look over the student' CANVAS account and have conversations about their grades, assignments, and assign goals.  Forms are scanned and emailed to parents weekly and mailed as progress reports every 4 Â½ weeks. Students and their advisory teachers also keep a detailed folder which includes student tracking of progress toward graduation. CANVAS is the LMS (Learning Management System). Course content was added throughout the year to allow students to work at their own pace. MHS implemented a 70% minimum on every assignment and test. Students were allowed to work at their own pace throughout the year.  Strong emphasis on community involvement through Friday talks from various community members, and opportunities to volunteer both on and off campus.

By that I mean it doesn't offer busing or provide student lunches, there are no extracurricular activities - sports or otherwise - so students don't leave school early to attend away contests, and there are no assemblies to disrupt the regular school day. While at first glance this might seem to be somewhat grim, the concept appears to be quite successful as is evidenced by the fact that enrollment/demand continues to increase, students are exceedingly well prepared for college and career, staff turnover is minimal, and both parents and community partners are enthusiastic supporters of the school and its emphasis on STEM education.   With a very business-like orientation, students come to """"work"""" from 8:00 to 4:00, Monday through Thursday and they all wear school-approved uniforms, are expected to have a strong work ethic, self discipline and are held accountable for the choices they make. Teachers do not accept late work from students at any grade level or in any subject area. Mornings are spent in traditional academic subjects, while every afternoon students are engaged in a variety of projects, both individually and in groups, to apply their learning. This model has allowed students at NISCA to excel in STEM to an unprecedented level for a small, rural school. Accomplishments include working with NASA to successfully launch a nano satellite and a trip to Washington DC to present to NASA engineers, senators and congressmen.

"Anonymous",324,2021,"Focus on mindset and relevant learning over pure content. Their open-walled focus comes from their foundation as an experiential, project-based learning environment. Twenty times a year, young learners take part in overnight expeditions that, as exemplified by just one learner, can include state park backpacking trips, MAAP STARS Leadership retreats, YMCA Youth in Government experiences, an autism conference in Iowa, Women in Sciences expeditions to New Orleans, and more.  Expeditions out into the world are but one modality through which young people can make their learning personalized, relevant, and contextualized. When young learners aren't traveling, they are exploring their unique interests and passions on campus. Educators are trained to look for the â€œlittle gemsâ€ each of their learners leans intoâ€”like reading books or public speakingâ€”so they can integrate broader learning experiences through those modes of learning and expression.  While these interests and learning strategies are being discovered, learner agency is being built. NWPHS learners are expected to do far more than just obtain the credits and grades they need to graduate. Instead, they are given the space to learn who they are and how they can direct their own learning, which results in the creation of personalized learning plans. Each plan includes independent project ideas, seminars or workshops the young learner plans to attend, their expedition schedule, and personal goal statements. Overall, these plans show young people how they can take advantage of what's available to them here and now, rather than waiting for that next phase, be it college or career, where life supposedly begins.  A learner's self-confidence grows exponentially through NWPH's many supportive structures, including their focus on advisories. When a learner first steps foot inside NWPHS, they are welcomed by familiar faces each morning, creating a socially embedded culture that makes room for taking healthy risks and judgment-free failure. This culture allows learners to develop their personalized leadership styleâ€”enabling quiet leaders to lead through action and motivational leaders to make their contribution by handing out words of encouragement."

Young learners (and their families) own the learning process.  From day one, families are enrolled through an intentional onboarding program. Family members explore and communicate their hopes and dreams for their kids, and the role they hope to play in seeing those dreams fulfilled. Young learners build a flexible learner profile that reveals their interests, aspirations, and challenges. With input from the whole family, a blueprint is created for connecting young learners with personalized, relevant, and contextualized opportunities.  In practice, this blueprint might land a young learner out in the community at a local food bank where socially embedded learning through conversations with staff, volunteers, and patrons is abundant. Within this open-walled experience, the young learner is deeply engaged in social, nutritional, and philanthropic studiesâ€”where the high-level, competency-based outcomes they develop carry over to whatever sparks the young learner's curiosity next.  Starting with general interests and passions rather than specific careers (or content standards) allows Odyssey learners (and their advisors) to gain exposure to once unknown possibilities. As they build their knowledge, skills, and dispositions within this learner-centered framework, they continuously develop a strong sense of learner agencyâ€”embracing their innate independence and leadership to explore what the world has to offer and how they can contribute to their community.  Learning at Odyssey meets every young learner where they are, which organically leads to a one-of-a-kind â€œrecipeâ€ of learning that is dynamic and palatable.

Rather than having one assigned teacher for the year, students in the SPARK School benefit from a team of educators. The educator team is led by the teacher executive designer, a certified teacher leader. The core educator team includes three additional certified teachers and two resident teacher candidates. The core team's composition may vary from year to year depending on student and educator needs, interests and strengths. The educator team collaboratively designs curriculum and multidisciplinary projects, acting as guides who empower students as active learners and problem-solvers.  Community educators with content area expertise act as additional educator team members who contribute their expertise to SPARK students. For example, a mindfulness coach visits the learning environment three times weekly to work with students on yoga and cognitive strategies.  The instructional model of SPARK is built on experiential learning, with an emphasis on Project-Based Learning (PBL) and inquiry. Students explore interdisciplinary themes across content areas, and their PBL units cross curricular areas. Projects emerge from student interests and are aligned with Arizona state standards. The educator team has the autonomy to leverage district-adopted curricular resources selectively, choosing the resources that best align with their PBL units and the standards being addressed.  SPARK students learn at a pace that fits their individual needs and have opportunities to explore their interests during Genius Hour and core instructional time. Educators recognize the value of having students from different backgrounds and with varied academic strengths, working together. The program is not tracked and includes students with a range of academic and socio-emotional needs. Educators employ various approaches to accommodate the students.  The SPARK School team is led by a teacher executive designer. The district created this position, which includes an additional stipend, with the goal of retaining highly effective educators and building advancement pathways that keep educators working directly with students. The teacher executive designer is a highly experienced certified teacher who models instructional practices, coaches fellow educators and oversees curriculum design. Importantly, the teacher executive designer is a full-time member of the classroom community rather than an instructional coach whose time is shared between multiple classrooms."

Their student body is made up of students from different ethnic, socio-economic, and academic levels, yet each receives a personalized program to fit their needs. For example, traditionally homeschooled students may choose to enroll with OVA because they still have control over their learning with support from certified teachers. Students who want more rigor than the traditional school enroll to move ahead faster. The school has partnerships with foster care and court programs where they provide the path for those students to continue their education. One student may take courses from three different vendors while another is taking two online courses, two college courses, an art course at a local community partner, and getting credit for a job through a work-based program.   I am always amazed at the perseverance and commitment they have for each individual student.

The advisory is designed to engage students in educational opportunities of their own choosing that integrate academic core knowledge with real world learning challenges. These self-directed learning opportunities are coupled with student-led assessments that assess the extent to which students have accomplished their learning goals.

"Vermont Agency of Education",389,2021,"As a local control state, when Vermont transitioned to proficiency based graduation requirements, each school district was left to develop its own specific requirements, informed by resources provided by the Agency of Education. Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion."
"Vermont Agency of Education",390,2021,"River Bend Career and Technical Center is a regional technical center that serves high school students from five sending school districts in Vermont and New Hampshire. It is a located in a very rural part of the state. Its high sending schools are small -- each with no more than 300 students in grades 9 through 12, and some with half that number.  On the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V)accountability measure for nontraditional program concentration, River Bend Career and Technical Center has the highest performance in Vermont. Defined as """"CTE concentrators enrolled in programs leading to a field non-traditional for their gender, as well as non-binary, non-conforming, and transgender students,"""" River Bend Career and Technical Center's three year average is 21.01%, compared to the overall state average of 11.71%.  River Bend Career and Technical Center believes this data represents work the center has done to create a safe, respectful, inclusive culture. Despite the fact that they have the highest performance on this measure in the state, the school's leadership team recognizes that there is more work to be done. Their Perkins V Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment identified areas for improvement, and their four year plan calls for continued work to increase the number of students enrolling in programs that are nontraditional for their gender.  In addition, after full staff training on preventing bullying and harassment and identifying and intervening when bullying and harassment occur, River Bend Career Technical Center gave deliberate consideration to creating learning environments that are safe and respectful for every student. As a result of this work, River Bend Career and Technical Center determined that they needed to have zero tolerance for displays of the Confederate flag (e.g. on student clothing, backpacks, notebooks, vehicles, etc.). Brian Emerson, the school's Director (Principal), reports that it was hard work, but they stayed the course. He notes that the work River Bend Career and Technical Center has done over the past five years has positioned them to continue to address issues of equity and inclusion and to work toward racial equity in a very rural community with limited racial diversity."
"Anonymous",391,2021,"Franklin West Supervisory Union (FWSU) has identified four target areas for continuous school improvement and student growth: student-centered, proficiency-based, personalized learning; flexible learning environments; student leadership; and engaged community partners. Along with all other schools in Vermont in compliance with Act 77, FWSU is also moving forward with a proficiency-based curriculum model that emphasizes essential academic concepts, content, and skills, including Transferable Skills, to help ensure our students are college and career-ready.â€¯ â€¯   The connections among the national standards, local curriculum, and classroom instruction and assessment play a critical role in an integrated design of engaging and relevant learning opportunities for students. Educators believe an integrated approach is the â€œbest fit'' for meeting targets. Project-based learning (PjBL) is one strategy used for integrating content. Although there are currently PjBL â€œislands of excellenceâ€ in science and world language, implementing this approach holds the potential for growth in the future.   Proficiency-driven opportunities highlight learning thatâ€¯isâ€¯personalized and learning environments that are flexible. FWSU's goal is to ensure that their students receive a â€œfuture-ready, world-class educationâ€ and graduate with the knowledge and skills to successfully pursue their goals.    Bellows Free Academy (BFA), the supervisory union high school, has been leading this work and providing guidance for the elementary schools. Outcome proficiencies cut across all four years of high schools with performance indicators being used to determine proficiency. Educators are refining common assessments and provide different pathways for students to achieve expected outcomes. The principal of BFA is a master at developing a schedule with blocks of varying amounts of time to create a learning environment that is responsive to the needs of learners. There is a comprehensive approach to supporting students. Educators know their students deeply and create a culture that is connected and authentic.   Performance assessments in grades eight and ten prepare students for a capstone project in twelfth grade. There are also pathways to distinction that are available which are personalized according to a student's interest. This opportunity â€œignites a fireâ€ for some students.  BFA administrators and staff have been engaged in learning and having conversations about equity for several years. Last spring, while on dismissal, racial justice became a  part of their student's world. School had ended for the summer, but leadership knew they couldn't wait for the fall to connect with students about this important issue. A group of teachers decided to put out an open invitation to have a discussion about what was going on in the world and how to move forward together. Around a dozen students joined the first zoom session. They asked questions about the return to school and other topics before the conversation shifted to equity and racial justice in their school. At first, the teachers facilitated the conversation, but somewhere in the middle of the summer, the students took over the agenda and the conversation. Their goal was to provide opportunities for the student body to join the conversation about racial justice in their school and in the world, and ultimately improve the culture of BFA. Thus, the Fairfax Racial Justice  Alliance (RJA) began. Since the start of the school year, students have been exposed to the four agreements and the compass from Courageous Conversations. They have had discussions about equity using case studies that explore socio-economic, cultural and racial bias, and equity. Work in advisory complements the goals of the BFA Fairfax  RJA.   Additionally, an early warning system approach is in place to examine if certain students are being marginalized. Educators recognize the importance of confronting evidence about which students are historically privileged, and which are not. This process is strengthening practices to support all learners. Both the student and the system levels are being analyzed to determine where inequities exist and how to implement change.

"Vermont Agency of Education",393,2021,"Randolph Union Middle/High School is designing for equity through the implementation of ongoing equity-focused professional development in the form of Professional Learning Communities. Faculty meet regularly in small groups to discuss current equity issues in the school and wider community, explore solutions, examine implicit bias, and to research and develop different curricular and pedagogical resources. These PLC groups provide a means through which to foster a culture of continuous equity learning amongst faculty, as well as a space to process personal experiences with inequity and bias. As part of RU's regularly scheduled professional development, the PLC structure is supporting faculty in developing equity as a lens through which to approach teaching and learning.  As part of this ongoing professional development, RU developed a set of social justice standards adapted from those published by Teaching Tolerance, called the Democratic Engagement Standards. These standards provide a structure through which teachers can design learning experiences that ask students to grapple with issues related to identity, equity, and structural injustice. RU is currently in the pilot year of using these standards, working towards identifying places in the curriculum that already provide opportunities to address these topics, in addition to places where these standards and topics could be further developed. As the Democratic Engagement Standards are not content-area specific, and can be integrated into any subject area, RU is actively working towards incorporating this essential work in classes beyond just the humanities.  The equity-focused PLC program also works to foster a culture of anti-racist action, encouraging teachers to collaboratively address systemic inequities in the school building. Student activism is encouraged and supported through project-based learning opportunities. Students organized and hosted the first ever state-wide student conference on racial justice in the Spring of 2019, bringing together students and activists from across Vermont. While the 2020 conference was postponed due to COVID-19, students continue to take action on injustice in their community through developing social justice lessons for younger students, writing letters to the editor, and supporting and amplifying the work of other activists in the state."

Hazen is committed to heterogenous grouping allowing students to choose an academic path best suited to their learning goals where each student selects a program reflecting their individual interests, abilities, and needs.  Hazen Union recently piloted a student-centered driven, student-designed, advanced manufacturing course and makerspace using student personalized learning plans (PLPs) as a tool for students to co-design and co-develop curriculum with teachers and community partners. This pilot expanded upon Hazen's well-established Work-Based Learning (WBL) Program and Independent Based Learning (IBL) Program. In response to COVID-19, Hazen Union and community partners leveraged the grant funded equipment to print face shields for Vermont doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The community partners worked with the students virtually throughout the process, providing opportunities to engage in design-thinking methods and skill attainment that could be applied across contexts. Upon completion of the pilot, the student cohort presented their curriculum, reflections, and deliverables to OSSU School Board members with recommendations to support the sustainability of this program. Students were empowered to demonstrate their competency in communication, advocacy, and action research in order to maintain this student-centered program for their peers. The success of this program conveys the importance of education and community partnerships and the positive impact student voice has within the school system and the community at large. This year, the program has tripled in size with the support of community partnerships. This unique learning model allows students to develop competency across content areas, technical skills, and transferable skills. Even throughout the pandemic Hazen Union continues to provide students the agency to personalize their learning inclusive of the instructional dispositions and learning models available within their WBL and IBL Programs."
"Anonymous",395,2021,"The leadership team at Missisquoi Valley Union (MVU) Middle and High School was able to hold two preliminary meetings and a train-the-trainer workshop focused on equity literacy with Paul Gorski. All members of the MVU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (DEI) Committee have a solid understanding of the principles and practices of equity literacy in education.  Educators from Swanton and Sheldon were intensively introduced to these principles and practices.  At MVU, several members of the DEI Committee feel fully prepared to plan and offer equity literacy professional learning to the staff. Additionally, an equity student survey was created, and feedback provided by the Equity Literacy Institute.  Educators secured funding to get the results of the survey professionally analyzed through an equity lens.   MVU has met the expectation of Proficiency-Based Learning with a thoughtful transition.  Early work was done 7 years ago to prioritize standards and create clear learning expectations, learning scales for common summative assessments, and school-wide habits of work.  Over the past 4 years, educators have implemented a more refined version of proficiency-based learning which includes a transition to proficiency-based grades, personalized course offerings, and robust and flexible â€˜keeping up and catching up' interventions.  As a highlight, the English Language Arts department has wholeheartedly embraced independent reading.  Students now meet their reading proficiencies by providing evidence from books that they choose.  Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: â€¢	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. â€¢	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. â€¢	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: â€¢	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. â€¢	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. â€¢	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: â€¢	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. â€¢	Begin Equity student focus groups. â€¢	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. â€¢	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. â€¢	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. â€¢	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL's 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.  MVU is in its 4th year of working with Think: Kids and using the Collaborative Problem-Solving approach with students.  Three staff are training to become certified Think: Kids trainers in order to grow the capacity to use Collaborative Problem Solving schoolwide."

"Anonymous",398,2021,"Sam Houston is in year 1 of implementing the Third Future Schools model, which has completely changed the culture of the school and opportunities for students. The model focuses on personalized learning and direct instruction with a focus on meeting more than solely academic needs.   Personalized learning is an approach to instruction that is centered on the student. It taps into a student's needs, strengths, and interests to engage students and to provide a â€œbest fitâ€ education for each student. The instruction is tailored to the individual needs of the student, and students learn in a way that best meets their learning style. Third Future's personalized learning program features four distinguishing characteristics: 1. Learner Profile is a summary of the student's academic history, strengths, interests, social-emotional needs, and how he learns best. It is developed with the student and the parents in order to let the school know how to provide a tailored education that meets the individual student's needs and goals. 2. Student Learning Plan is the individualized, academic plan that will enable the student to reach academic proficiency and meet his other learning goals. It outlines the part of a student's curriculum that will be taught directly and the activities and lessons that will be customized for the student. 3. Flexible Learning Environment allows students to have a more tailored schedule and allows the teacher to use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction. Students may receive some instruction in a large group (25 students) or work in a small group, with a partner, or by himself. With the help of technology, and because the doors of the school will be open from 6:30 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., students may also learn before school, after school, or at home. 4. Competency-Based Education allows students to learn at their own pace. If a student has already mastered an objective or standard, they can move on to accelerated objectives or to a topic related to their other learning goals. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, she can take more time and received more individualized or small group instruction.   Third Future is also implements the """"dyad"""" concept that establishes requirements for experiences that are often only available to students with means, such as participating in sports, learning an instrument, traveling, and more. Third Future provides these experiences to students who are not able to afford them.   Students in the upper grades at Sam Houston also take a course called The Art of Thinking. To my knowledge, Third Future Schools spend the most time on teaching critical thinking and informational literacy, which is so critical to our current society.   Finally, Sam Houston is currently open from 6:30-4:30 (and even later outside of the current pandemic), which provides families free before and after school care. Sam Houston has done an incredible job operating (safely) during the pandemic and was featured in the local news paper. The school offered in person instruction much earlier than other local schools."
"Fielding International",399,2021,"Over the past four years, Hilton Head Christian Academy has partnered with Fielding International to design, develop, and deliver the best combination of educational spaces and learning strategies, as the school transitions from traditional teaching methodologies to project- and inquiry-based, experiential learning practices.   During the building development phase, the design team worked closely with regional architects to blend Hilton Head's natural environment and school culture into structural realities.  A large investment into on-site exposure and training aided the entire school community in understanding the value of open-design concepts, why seating and learning communities need to be flexible and serve multiple purposes, and how to maximize authentic learning opportunities within and around the physical building.  Consistent reviews of best practices and local regulations mirrored the academic process underlying the pedagogical shift and engaged a multitude of stakeholders (families, faculty, community, alumni, and students) in the design process.  Increased student voice and agency in the means by which learning can happen manifest a more interactive approach to learning at school; even under the current, physically-distanced limitations, the pillars for collaborative, creative, and authentic learning communities have been placed.  From these foundations, we look to continue to reimagine the way students can take on learning and create authentic and actionable community connections."

Teachers have moved to use Google Classroom as the primary interface with students. The Batesville School District has allowed students to choose between 3 different learning environments this school year, based on the parent and student preference. Most of our students are in person or remote, which for BJHS means the student is joining a physical classroom via Google Meet from an alternate location. This allows the student to take part in classroom discussions and have access """"real-time"""" to a teacher but doing so from the safety of their location of choice.  As far as doing things differently, BJHS is a one to one school. All students are issued a Chromebook, and the vast majority of our curriculum is provided via a digital format. Because BJHS had chosen to go one to one a few years ago, the staff and students were already in a situation to pivot to off-site learning when COVID struck our area. Though there were issues to resolve, our district was in a strong position to roll out digital learning to students. When this school year began, all students were given 3 options regarding how they would receive their education. Students were given the option of attending in person, attend """"remotely"""" (which is described above), or attending virtually.   Virtual instruction at BJHS consisted of students accessing courseware via Edgenuity or Lincoln Learning and working at their own pace.

"Learning Policy Institute",409,2021,"Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School, located in Boyle Heights in East LA, is a full-service community school that places its students and their futures at the heart of its equity-oriented vision. Mendez operated as a community school long before it became one of the first members of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Community School cohort in 2019. This means that the school prioritizes the four pillars of a community school: integrated student supports (wraparound services), extended learning time and opportunity, distributed leadership, and family and community engagement. Students understand that their wellbeing is at the heart of the school's mission. In 2019, 85% of students reported feeling safe at Mendez and 81% of students reported that they are happy to be at Mendez (LAUSD School Experience Survey, 2019). At Mendez, student learning is also a priority, and the school's graduation rates have risen dramatically in the ten years since its founding in 2009. The school began with a graduation rate of nearly 50% and now has a graduation rate of over 84%, 90% of whom go to college.  As part of the school's focus on integrated student supports, Mendez High School partners with a number of different community organizations that provide services to students and their families. These community partners fulfill different roles on campus and can engage in case management, put on whole-school events, and offer group supports. Individual case management organizations, like Promesa Boyle Heights or Communities in Schools LA, provide one-on-one supports to students and families, often targeting dropout prevention and academic engagement through mental health supports or other interventions. The school also recently broke ground on a Wellness Center, where it will be able to provide mental and physical health resources to the Boyle Heights community. This Wellness Center is the result of over 10 years of organizing by the school and its community partners.   The school also holds high academic expectations for its students and launched two initiatives that target student learning gains: AP for All and Computer Science for All. As part of these initiatives, all Mendez students take at least one AP course and at least one Computer Science course prior to graduation. Many students choose to continue taking AP and Computer Science courses once they are exposed to the experience. Teachers and parents were concerned at the outset of the AP for All initiative that students would all choose to take AP Spanish, as the student population is predominantly Latino/a/x and there is a higher proportion of English Learners at Mendez than there are across the district and statewide. And yet, students have demonstrated an interest in a variety of AP courses since the initiative began. The school also focuses on the needs of students with disabilities and uses an inclusion model to ensure that students with special needs are given the same opportunities to learn as their peers.   Mendez's principal, Mauro Bautista, models a culture of distributed leadership. This is reflected in many of the aspects of the school, including its multiple governing bodies that include a variety of stakeholders throughout the community. There is a School Site Council, Local School Leadership, the School Culture Committee, the Family Action Team, and the House of Student Representatives. Many of the initiatives that are currently central to Mendez's approach are the result Principal Bautista seeking feedback from educators and families to guide decisions, including the school's Restorative Justice, Computer Science for All, and AP for All initiatives, which were all started by Mendez teachers.  The school has a hands-on approach to family and community engagement, which it leveraged when the pandemic closed LAUSD schools. Mendez staff and community partners reached out to every student and family, and if they could not contact anyone they did home visits. At these home visits, they provided an array of services, including delivering food or supplies and providing mental health check-ins. They also leveraged these relationships with families to determine how to deliver instruction in the Fall of 2020. Teachers, families, and students came together over the summer to determine the master schedule in the fall. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. They began planning for hybrid learning, where students will be on-campus part-time and their instruction will be aligned across the virtual and in-person learning environments.  Being on Mendez's campus is a joyful experience. Students whom you speak with readily share their learning, parents are frequently on campus volunteering or taking classes at its Family Center, and school leaders like Principal Bautista are often wandering the halls or working in the library because they both want to be accessible to the community and because they probably gave their office away to a community partner who is visiting campus. I'm excited to nominate Mendez because it is truly a community-based initiative that puts social and racial justice at the center of its decisions, which are all in service of the bright future of its students."

The school is based on a model that prioritizes student inquiry and a deep respect for the student experience.

Instruction is primarily through inquiry-based methods and active learning approaches, where the teacher serves as facilitator and coach to support student learning. Instruction includes an emphasis on social-emotional learning, and classrooms are student-centered with students working in small collaborative groups, individually, and through child-initiated play. This model, which was developed with concepts from improv, is a K-8 school that truly has a sense of student ownership and responsiveness. The twice yearly learning showcase hosted by the school gives students a chance to walk parents and community members through their own independent projects developed throughout the year.  ITDS has its own teacher residency program and as such serves as an embedded professional learning community that utilizes master teachers to mentor new teachers in Inspired teaching.

Promise's students posted 2019 math achievement rates higher than schools in DC's predominantly white and affluent Ward 3. The team's approach to morning-afternoon split math instruction is fairly novel. Educators teach a lesson in the morning and utilize data from exit tickets to design the afternoon's math activities.

"Fielding International",427,2021,"Cranston Public Schools (CPS) is an average-sized American public school district of twenty-two schools that serve an economically and ethnically diverse population.  Cranston is the third-largest city in Rhode Island, and typical of most American cities, most of its schools were built in the 1950s and '60s. Despite the advanced age of many schools in the District, CPS leadership proclaimed that """"we must go beyond warm, safe and dry."""" We had just completed a comprehensive school facility plan, reinventing and reimagining Cranston's schools for the new twenty years and beyond. When approached by CPS District leadership to identify a potential â€œPathfinderâ€ or demonstration project, the Eden Park School presented a golden opportunity.   The School has a very progressive Principal and a teaching staff that was ready to reimagine and redefine their roles as teachers by letting go of the assumptions of what used to be school. They have fully embraced project-based learning and the five stages of finding a solution, real-time collaboration, and a flexible schedule to match their learning environment' flexibility.   Eden Park Learning Community is an ensemble of student-centered collaborative spaces. Moving away from the one teacher, one room, and sole care of one group of students, it is an environment that supports learner-agency, transparent technology, and fosters a wide variety of teaching and learning situations. These situations range from small group and independent study to whole group instruction or one-on-one with a teacher. The spaces also emphasize the importance of teacher collaboration by deprivatizing the planning process and include workspaces that allow teachers to work both independently and collaboratively.  The adoption of the Learning Community model at Eden Park has brought more flexibility and variety in day-to-day learning activities.  The old corridor was absorbed into the Learning Commons, leading to an agile space that supports multiple ways of learning, and multiple groups of learners.  This type of shared commons created a diffuse distribution of students and collaborative work areas.  Transparency between Learning Studios and the Commons facilitates interdisciplinary PBL learning for kids, adults, and folks who push-into these spaces for special services. The teachers have embraced industry experts and community partnerships in every way. Industry partners now plan with teachers, launch projects, and are utilized for feedback throughout each stage in the problem-solving process.   Teacher professional development through FI is embedded into the fabric of their work. Cranston is involved in ongoing professional development, which includes a three-year teacher coaching program. Teachers develop mastery in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum. Each year, the program becomes more student-centered, with learners identifying and defining problems and projects themselves by year three.   The results are in: at the 3rd-5th Grade Learning Community at the Eden Park School, the first completed, the level of engagement, personalization and physical comfort has reduced absences, seen a huge drop in disciplinary issues, and all but eliminated the need for specialized isolation and decompression rooms for students with special needs--instead, they are thriving within a suite of spaces shared by everyone in their learning community. The result is more learning, more joy, and less space required."

At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects.

The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  â—	Create a culture of â€œDeep Learningâ€ in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; â—	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; â—	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; â—	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; â—	Develop a list of â€œinstructional lensesâ€;  â—	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  â—	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpack' tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them. Place-based learning supports the development of a sense of wonder, grows student' social-emotional skills, increases engagement, and builds a better understanding of the world.   Windsor Central Unified Union School District has engaged in racial equity work with the support of Writing Wrongs, LLC. The Windsor Central School Board's anti-racist work is focused on creating anti-racist policy. They have received a grant to dig further into current anti-racist efforts, starting with school board members and leadership within the system. An equity audit will be used to gather data regarding the current status.   The Leadership Team commits to adopting a more visible stance of active listening, collective learning, internal reflection, and critical evaluation of current practice. This stance and any action plans will be developed with the help of partnerships with individuals and organizations centered on this work to expose systemic racism embedded in our educational system. Leadership commits to providing students with an education that is explicitly anti-racist and refuses to turn away from the hard truths of our history."

"Vermont Agency of Education",473,2023,"The Winooski Middle High School (WMHS) is strengthening and innovating upon existing programming to boost its STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) access to all students. The WMHS Computer-Based Music-Making Program launched in 2021, driven by student interest. The Computer-Based Music Making Program is a class offered to students that allows them to create, record, and produce their own music or audio recordings using computer technology. Approximately 45% of WMHS students have resettled in Winooski through the refugee resettlement program. Among them, they speak around 20 languages, predominantly Swahili, Somali, French, and Nepali. For these students, music is a common language. For some Winooski students, who struggle academically, music has been an anchor, keeping them connected to the district and providing an outlet for their talent. Many students want to make music in their own languages or write songs that students can sing in class. This program has enabled students to express themselves and connect with other students, and the broader community and is an excellent way to be inclusive and provide equitable access to arts education.
 

 Additionally, Winooski’s promise to their community includes: 
 Students have voice and choice in their learning.  
 • Students are excited about the topics they are learning as they are tied to their interests and their futures. 
 • Learning is personalized and is relevant and meaningful to each student. 
 • Each student develops a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs, interests and passions. 
 • Students own their learning, are confident, and are willing to take on leadership roles. 
  
 The Winooski High School environment encourages student DISCOVERY and RETENTION of learning. 
 • Each student’s individual learning needs are supported. 
 • Students choose how they learn and how they demonstrate their learning. 
 • Students advance at their own pace, with guidance from their advisor. 
 • Students move toward graduation as they master each topic. 
 • Classes are small in size and enable teachers to engage and challenge each student’s learning style and ability. 
  
 Winooski High School is preparing students for SUCCESS in the 21st century. 
 • Through our GXs and GPs, students learn new transferable skills like communication, critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration; essential skills that will help students work in ever-changing, diverse workplaces. 
 • Students study real-world topics through project-based learning which takes a topic a student is interested in and ties it with the skills the student needs to develop in particular areas, including math, science and English. 
 • Our schools’ diversity enables students to think globally, gain a deeper understanding of the world, and provides students with a unique leverage in achieving success in career and life. 
 • We focus on the whole student, mind, spirit and body and help students appreciate that wellness is something that they need and should carry on through life."

"MiCoOp",475,2021,"There are many reasons I am excited to nominate Link Learning, but the main reasons are their partnerships with schools around the state and how they use their data to improve student learning. Link Learning partners with brick and mortar schools that have exhausted their options for students who need a personalized learning plan and individual support. While most of these students are at-risk, Link Learning also serves the non-traditional learner like homeschoolers, professional high school athletes, students with unique medical conditions, youth in the justice system, and early parents. Students take just one or two courses at a time. Even though Link Learning is a virtual school, they have learning centers around the state for students to come and learn in a welcoming, supportive environment. Their partnership with the brick and mortar schools also allow their students to take seated courses.   Link Learning uses a tool to manage student engagement and progress. The program was developed in partnership with a software development company and their district, including virtual teachers. It automatically collects data from their LMS and records their staff interactions to get a whole-child view of each student. Within this system, they have the ability to see where a student falls in MTSS so they can intervene more quickly. The data is reviewed daily by teachers, weekly by learning center directors, and monthly by the quality assurance team (who support staff professional learning). Their data shows that the more intentional the teacher-student conversations, the more students are engaged, and the greater their academic achievement. These intentional conversations focus on helping students understand their role in learning, making a plan to fit education into their lives, and reflecting on their progress.   There is also a heavy focus on social-emotional learning. The school has staff specifically assigned to EL students, 13 special education staff, and social workers who work with students and staff. Relationships are built between students, staff, and parents to develop a community where they all feel they belong. Professional learning for staff includes shifting mindsets. First, they must understand that getting at-risk students to enroll is a success in itself. Once enrolled, they need to create connections and relationships so they are taught how to talk and relate to students. After relationships are built and students start engaging, they can focus conversations on learning such as time on task, number of days in class, and what they did when they were successful. The staff also works with students to help them self-regulate with the goal for them to become effective members of society."

"MiCoOp",478,2021,"Not many virtual schools offer a drop-in center for middle school students. West Michigan Virtual Academy (WMVA) serves middle and high school students, grades 6-12. When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around student' social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.  Their drop-in center is located at the city's recreation center so WMVA has the ability to offer their virtual lifetime fitness classes with an in-person component. They also offer optional career field trips and guest speakers for all 300 students. Before COVID, the drop-in lab would regularly see 30-40 students who came in for assistance, many of them showing up multiple times a week. WMVA also has partnerships with the local career tech center and three local colleges where students can earn career skills and/or college credits."

2. Partnerships and Funding: The district received intentional support from the Straight A Fund in Ohio's state biennial budget, enabling them to create customized, personalized learning experiences. Partnerships with construction and architecture firms like Skanska Megen Construction Co. Inc. and SHP helped build innovative, project-based learning spaces.
3.Student Involvement in Design Process: Students from grades 6-12 actively participated in the design process of the new buildings. The design was aligned with the educational vision, focusing on six key shifts in education and incorporating hallmarks of PBL instruction.
4.Identified Foundational Needs: Through this effort, foundational needs of students were recognized, including a desire for collaboration, a student-centric culture, engaging learning opportunities, various workshop sizes, mobility within the learning environment, active engagement, and access to technology in different forms.

The district's approach not only focused on physical infrastructural changes but also on aligning the design with the educational philosophy, ensuring that the learning spaces reflect the principles of project-based learning. The active involvement of students in the process indicates a commitment to meeting their needs and preferences.

Overall, the transformation of Winton Woods School District showcases a comprehensive effort to create an environment that supports innovative and student-focused learning experiences.

"Vermont Agency of Education",583,2023,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country were forced to re-evaluate their priorities and restructure their operations to do their part in keeping students safe. For White River Valley Middle School, this meant shifting their classes from the traditional school building to a series of outdoor classrooms housed in tents across the campus and students sorted into “pods” with peers that shared similar schedules to minimize potential for cross-contamination. These were emergency measures, initially designed with only the immediate health and safety of students in mind. However, the opportunities to advance innovative educational strategies were not lost on school leadership. The shift to outdoor classrooms allowed for a flourishing of place-based curriculum, with students being encouraged to see the living world around them as a co-equal partner in their educational process. The reorganized pod structure created a new, small-group space where students could build relationships and adult mentors could give students more consistent attention.  
 

 We are moving into the endemic phase of COVID-19, and many of the emergency measures are beginning to subside. The tents that dotted the White River Valley Middle School campus are gone and students have returned to receiving instruction inside the school building, but that’s not to say things have returned to the way they were before. Students and teachers are still encouraged to look at learning with a place-based lens, students are still being taught to look at nature as a source for knowledge, and once a week students are still meeting with their pods to engage in restorative practices. In my eyes, this is the triumph of their leadership team. They were able to take the potential disruption of the pandemic and turn it into an opportunity to grow and strengthen."

"New Tech Network",646,2024," To create a school of innovative creators where all members of the community are respected and all students have warm demanders as facilitators, Compass Academy implemented new cultural practices at both the learner and adult level to establish a more supportive and inclusive culture. School leadership, teachers, and staff challenged students to embrace high standards for learning and college/career planning. Evidence for advancing student-centered learning can be observed with the adoption of and adaption of Marzano High Reliability Schools™ framework as a part of student, faculty and staff recognitions; using the framework indicators to empower their school teaching staff and students (Source: Marzano, R. J., Phil Warrik, and Julia A. Simms. A Handbook for High Reliability Schools: The Next Step in School Reform. Marzano Research, 2014.)  By adopting such a framework, the school has expanded the framework of standards to include competencies with performance assessments and academic skills that are transferable across content areas. Compass Academy students know exactly where they are and what they need to do next. This is an important component to enhancing supportive and inclusive culture experiences as this added “a level of fun and engagement that [the school] did not predict. It’s been an excellent investment in the human capital of Compass Academy.”  This leading indicator can be seen in action through restorative practice in the classrooms, using the “Good Things” protocol from Capturing Kids’ Hearts (Capturing Kids’ Hearts: A Three-Year Program Evaluation, 2016-17 to 2018-19, May 2020, https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED606969.pdf).  The “Project Expo” (senior capstone projects) allowed for new and potential students to share their best projects of the year to the public and school board; demonstrating Compass Academy’s school teaching tenets alignment to project-based learning.

During the intervention/enrichment block on the schedule, students get what they need…either support in math and/or reading or an enrichment opportunity.

In courses, students have the opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills for proficiency through a variety of learning experiences and assessments. Each department has delineated two to eight discipline-specific proficiencies that a student is required to meet for graduation. When a student receives credit for a particular course that is an indication that the proficiencies have been met. Taken together, the proficiencies or credits gained will provide a cumulative body of evidence that students have met overall school-wide and discipline-specific graduation expectations and are ready to graduate. 
 

 All students at CHS develop a Personalized Learning Plan. This plan documents a CHS student’s journey. The options for students include but are not limited to, community service, outside coursework, student aide assignments, work-study, independent study, online learning, Advanced Placement courses, Technical Centers, Dual-Enrollment courses, Early College, and internships. In addition, students may apply to Target Graduation, an outcomes-based graduation program, or may apply to attend Colchester Alternative Program (CAP) a smaller learning environment.
 

 The work of educators at Colchester High School is guided by the following Core Beliefs:
 ● We engage in diverse learning experiences rooted in relationships, relevance, rigor, and shared responsibility.
 ● We work together to build on one another's strengths and perspectives.
 ● We cultivate a strong and connected community that respects and celebrates all Lakers.
 ● We demonstrate respect and compassion for ourselves, one another, and our school.
 ● We create safe spaces where all Lakers can thrive.
 ● We empower all Lakers to use their voice, pursue their aspirations, and be active and engaged members of our community.
 

 Educational decisions are guided by the belief that proficiency-based learning practices in an environment of strong support for students’ social and emotional needs will enable them to meet these expectations."

"Alliance for Catholic Education",659,2023,"St. Patrick's is transforming its instructional core to be aligned with Blended Learning Practices."
"Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship",660,2023,"As a school community, One World Middle School has reimagined the learning of what education looks like in how students experience school as a whole. At the foundational core, they believe that students have the right to a quality and innovative standards-based education, the right to know and be known in a safe and welcoming environment, and the right to be acknowledged as unique individuals who learn differently. These core beliefs promote and advance equity and student-centered learning throughout the school. It is evident upon walking through the halls, the classrooms, and interacting with the students that their core beliefs live and breathe through how they view the purpose of education and the instructional core, and the structures they deem important.
 

 One World Middle School has proven that in order to have a reimagined equitable learning environment, two components must be in place: a safe learning environment and a staff that knows who the children are and their individual needs. To support this idea they have implemented practices and events such as Ambassador Day, Unit 0, and Developing the Whole Child Meeting (DWC). Ambassador Day is quite the experience as students across all grades are given the opportunity to select their mentors for the year. During this particular day, students engage in community-building activities by spending the entire day in small groups with their teacher mentor discussing their commonalities and differences and learning to embrace each other diversity and strengths. Throughout the year the mentors meet weekly to plan and conduct themed-based activities. For example, in November and December, mentor groups coordinate events and activities around gratitude and acts of kindness respectively. These student-led initiatives have taken different forms over the years from groups creating donation drives, reading to students at neighborhood elementary schools, making edible treats that are distributed to fellow peers, volunteering at Senior Health Centers to simply redesigning a classroom space. 
 

 In thinking about how to continually engage students and to make sure all learners see themselves in the curriculum, One World Middle School acknowledges and celebrates the various cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity that comprises the school community through their first unit of the year. One World Middle School in all grades and content areas uses the first unit of the year which is called Unit 0 to focus on student identity and understanding the child. In addition, there are weekly meetings programmed called Developing the Whole Child (DWC) where teacher teams create action plans for ambassadors who may need support academically, socially, or emotionally. These strategies are often grounded in the Pre-referral Intervention Manual (PRIM) or Adaptation for Adolescents with Autism and Asperger's manual (A-5) to tailor the support to effectively meet the needs of the student. The teams continually discuss the outcomes of the strategy with each other as well including the student for their input. Teams reflect on progress as they monitor the impact on student learning.  
 

 At One World it is evident that they are thoughtful about the language they use with their students and in their space. It is a common belief that the process for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that equitably supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults begins with language which is clearly intertwined in the fabric of the school. The school truly believes that the words students encounter on daily basis, they will in turn embody. Thus, students are addressed as ambassadors because they are encouraged and provided with opportunities to be agents of change. The word ambassador coincides with the school's construction as they operate under a United Nations model where ambassador voices are influential in the way the school functions and the changes that occur. An example of a system in place is the school's embassy delegates which include members from all grades that meet biweekly with the principal. These meetings range from discussing issues and making suggestions, to planning events such as LGBTQ Coming Out Day, Autism Awareness Day, or Breast Cancer Awareness Day which is driven by the consensus of the student body. These student-centered planned events foster a level of self and others. Every morning during morning assembly the school gathers together to proclaim as one voice, """"I want today to be one of the greatest days of my life"""" to establish a positive feeling and tone for the day. As a mantra, to work and live by, the school leadership believes and promotes that each year they must create a learning environment and community that is more impactful than the previous year. 
 

 It is without a doubt, that the ambassador's academic outcome is at the core of One World Middle School's instructional focuses and practices. They have demonstrated that ambassadors learn best when they have an opportunity to collaborate with peers and then make their thinking visible. Practices in place to support that students constantly engage with other students start with the structure of how the room is designed. At One World all classes are designed to accommodate a variety of grouping configurations. These configurations support opportunities over the course of a lesson for ambassadors to engage in turn and share and work on group assignments as well as projects in a seamless manner. Teachers have collaborated on phased protocols to promote partner discussions. As a best practice, all classrooms are equipped with two certified teachers to ensure that on a daily basis all needs of their children are met. Teachers take a less active role in talking in the classroom being mindful of the fact that the one that is speaking, is the one doing most of the learning. Therefore, in a One World classroom ambassadors are often engaged in discussions about the planned tasks, and activities in an effort to meet the day's objective where the teachers utilize a series of questions or prompt to cognitively challenge students thinking to either spark ambassador questions or to promote metacognition. 
 

 Ambassadors making connections and providing opportunities is an extremely critical component of the school. For example, the entire student body annually engages in Science Day where ambassadors take their learning to design experiments and projects. Additionally, all students participate in a school-wide dissection that is tiered by grade to investigate the systems, and scientific benefits to society and to ponder the ethical consequences. All ambassadors in the 8th grade take high-school level courses (Living Environment, US History, English 11, Algebra). As a result, 8th graders start their high school careers a grade ahead which allows them to have access to a college course for free or graduate a year early. Students at One World have the opportunity to visit colleges they have expressed interest in that are located locally and across state lines. Some of the colleges toured include Boston College, Harvard, Yale, SUNY Oneota, Howard, and many others. From touring colleges students who have graduated have enrolled in colleges such as Boston College and other SUNY programs. Through their expeditionary trips to monumental sites in history, like Selma, Gettysburg, and The Capitol ambassadors have been able to make connections to topics discussed in their classes.
 

 Other practices that are embedded at One World include a dedicated department and common planning time for teachers to meet, plan and revise units that are tailored specifically for the students they teach. Student-initiated clubs and student electives where ambassadors get an opportunity to express their interests and preferences for electives in a series of exit interviews."

With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, choice boards, and student interests were targeted strategies. With the COVID pandemic in 2020, BLPS soon realized they would need to dig deeper into the development and implementation of learning pathways to support all learners. Concerned about learning loss when virtual school was the only option, teachers engaged in professional collaboration to address those learning gaps. Prioritizing standards in ELA and Mathematics was a first step in the construction of an equitable viable Learning Continuum, where progressions of learning and readiness assessments were developed for the standards. As teachers continued to collaborate in both grade level and vertical teams, it was clear the curriculum work they had done served a larger purpose than addressing learning gaps – it had in fact provided an opportunity to foster agency in all learners! Date tracking and goal setting soon belonged to the 4- and 5-year-old kindergartners, first and second graders, and progress monitoring and celebrations of learning soon followed, where the outcome was student ownership of the learning!

"KnowledgeWorks",754,2023,"At Rio Rico High School, located in the Santa Cruz Valley Unified School District No 35, in Rio Rico, Arizona, students and staff all know how to """"REP”.  Based on the core values of Relationships, Excellence, and Pride the faculty embraces creating the best learning environments possible for their students.  Three years ago, as the school began thinking more critically about equitable outcomes for all learners, they expanded and deepened opportunities for students to own their learning.  Flexibility with time resulted in RRHS allowing students to build individualized learning schedules depending on their interests and situation. All grade levels offer three distinct options - face to face instruction, distance learning, and flex-scheduling - to provide students agency when deciding on the environment that best meets their needs. Wednesdays provide intervention and enrichment services for students and personalized professional development for staff.
 
In anticipation of transitioning to a standards-based system for reporting on learning, the principal facilitated a voluntary book study on Grading for Equity, by Joe Feldman.  Avant-garde teachers now implement more equitable grading practices to their level of comfort and understanding.  This behavior has grown the network of interested teachers and expanded the grass roots of implementation in advance of a full transition in SY24.  

Administration also emphasizes student voice.  Beyond creative student scheduling, a student senate meets regularly to offer insight and guidance on decision-making, student artwork beautifies the campus in multiple areas, and a student cheering section actively drives school spirit!  Through the combination of voice and choice, the students REP in palpable ways.
 
With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, distance/flex scheduling, SOPs, and student voice remain the primary strategies advancing the school-wide mantra """"We REP!""""

"KnowledgeWorks",756,2023,"For the past four years, Cibola High School, one of six high schools in Yuma Union High School district, has been reimagining education by putting systems in place to support learner-centered practices. Key in the shift is a focus on mastery learning and an expectation of student success – no matter what it takes. Three years ago, a small group of teachers and the principal began studying and applying standards-based grading principles. Today, over 60 percent of the staff participate. The shift has evolved into equitable systems of grading and assessment across the campus, resulting in student agency and ownership of the learning. Students know the vision is for them to attain the highest level of proficiency/mastery. If they don’t succeed on the first attempt, they’ll have choice and opportunity to reassess. The staff believes that all students can succeed, and they insist on rigor by not allowing them to fail. Students own their learning and share their data with parents in regular emails. Collaboration, project-based learning, and flexible seating environment enable learners to flourish academically. 

Developing leadership and ensuring voice are critical at Cibola. The Courtesy Corps of student leaders in each classroom greet visitors and explain the focus of the day’s learning. Administration ensures student voice shapes the school culture. For example, a student focus group will roll out the new Portrait of a Graduate to the student body and provide ideas on systems to embed the POG in Cibola daily life. Adult agency has grown from teachers learning from teachers (TLFT). Teachers lead professional learning opportunities, participate in peer-to-peer classroom observations and feedback loops, and choose their personal learning pathways to grow their practice. Leaders provide time and support for the adult learning; as a result, teachers completed 82 digital PCBL learning modules in November. The Culture and Climate at Cibola High School has purposefully shifted. Staff believes that all students can succeed, and the focus is on developing the “whole student”, with student growth being the priority.

The academic program provides multiple learning pathways that enable every learner to be college, career, and community ready on a personal path.  Learners track their data and regularly set goals during time designated across the campus. All teachers offer choice through Universal Design for Learning, allowing students options in how to access, engage, and demonstrate learning. Choice boards, multiple assessment opportunities, and collaboration in small groups based on data provide a just-right learning environment. The early shifts to standards-based grading are providing an equitable system of assessment and reporting. 

Agency is a natural outcome of the options at San Luis. Besides the conventional structures such as Student Council and National Honor Society, student voice is intentionally amplified through the principal’s Student Advisory group, where students are leading a positive campus culture. Students co-created school-wide standard operating procedures for campus issues like cell phone usage, hallways, etc., to ensure a safe, productive environment. The robust Career Technical Student Organizations provide a platform for leadership growth and demonstration of personal achievement through national competitions.

"Bluum",811,2024,"Alturas International Academy is an innovative change for education. With a master approach to education, their students are taught in small group instruction at instructional levels. This gives students the opportunity to work with partners and collaborate at high levels using analytical and critical thinking skills. Alturas Prep will expand on an already established program that teaches self-discipline and responsibility to all students; provides a physical environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning; promotes communication and interaction in the classroom; supports an effective environment that promotes a sense of belonging and self esteem; and provides an academic environment that promotes learning and self-fulfillment.

The Alturas International Academy uses the Primary Years Program (PYP) designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) as a curriculum framework for young learners. Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to react, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment. Like all IB programs, PYP is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas. In the process, students develop critical thinking, research, self-management, communication, and social skills.

At Alturas, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six trans-disciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry are:

Who we are
Where we are in place and time
How we express ourselves
How the world works
How we organize ourselves
Sharing the planet

Units of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, information technology, science, and social studies, helping students make meaningful connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.

INQUIRY-BASED:
The Primary Years Program (PYP) is based on a commitment to inquiry-based teaching and the development of the whole child; socially, emotionally, and intellectually. A core belief is that children learn more effectively when they are actively involved in the learning process and build upon existing knowledge in real-life contexts – In other words, when learning is relevant and engaging.

MULTILINGUAL: 
Spanish is the language of instruction in our K–5 elementary school program.  We welcome students from all language backgrounds. Over 80% of our students begin with no Spanish language at home.

NURTURING ENVIRONMENT: 
Alturas' smaller class sizes ensure that the teachers and staff can focus on students’ social and emotional development in addition to their intellectual progress. From a place of safety, students are encouraged to inquire, wonder, and investigate—to lay the foundations of interculturally sensitive and inquisitive lives.

EXPERIENCED, CARING TEACHERS: 
Alturas' teachers provide opportunities for students to build meaning and refine understanding through structured inquiry. Outside the classroom, Alturas teachers are an integral part of our community.

REAL-WORLD CONNECTIONS: 
Students synthesize and showcase their learning by applying new knowledge to real-world problems and working collaboratively to find solutions.  For example, 5th-grade students work in groups to prepare an exhibition and presentation about a topic of their choice, showcasing their self-guided learning to the community.

Herron High School’s founders and founding board believed it was essential to bring the very best educators to the table during the development phase of the school. Beginning with Robert Marzano’s concept of designing a curriculum “with the end in mind,” and guided by best practices in the classroom, the founder’s vision of a well-educated, world-class citizen helped define the rigorous curriculum, classical format, and cultural foundation for the school.
Herron High School's core values are that every student is a scholar, engages in an urban community, advances timeless ideas and content, builds a culture of respect and trust through relationships with people and ideas, and serves as a catalyst for renewal.
These core values are innovative but rooted in classical, liberal arts traditions. Herron is college-preparatory, and is rated as the top Indianapolis public school, and in the top 1 percent in the Nation, for college preparation, and has set the standard to to stay diverse. "

To provide equitable access for all students in the district, transportation is provided from all elementary schools for families wishing to attend Innovation.   This purposeful design has helped to diversify the population of our students, families, and staff.

To provide flexibility for students, Innovation Heights Academy operates on a half day model. Students come to school Monday through Thursday for either the morning (8:30-11:30am) or afternoon session (12:00-3:00pm).

Students have the opportunity to progress toward graduation faster. Students can earn up to 9 credits in a year, as compared to 6 credits in a year in a traditional model. 

Instruction at Innovation Heights Academy is two hours each day. Students engage in project-based learning through cross-curricular learning blocks. Learning focuses on developing real-world skills which will be related to students’ individual goals. 

In order to ensure that they are preparing students to be successful in life beyond high school, they allow space for students to learn about life balance and wellness. Students spend one hour a day focusing on physical, mental, and social wellness.

Fridays are required for students who are struggling with attendance, behavior, or grades each week. Weekly, students meet with their advisor to discuss their progress toward their goals and determine if they need assistance re-engaging in their work. If students are making adequate progress on their goals, students can still come on Friday for access to clubs, community partners, and other connections."

"New Tech Network",877,2024,"Since it's implementation in 2015, Owensboro Innovation Academy (OIA)  leaders regularly attend NTN professional development trainings and workshops to continually improve their classroom instructional practices and receive coaching services and ongoing support.
The community partnerships program at OIA has created opportunities for students and community members to connect over shared projects — so much so that OIA was recognized in early 2022 by the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce and named Education & Workforce Development Institution of the Year. “OIA creates a love for knowledge and intellectual curiosity, and creates learners that contribute back to the local economy,” said Chamber President Candance Brake. “The community partnerships with OIA also help many people in these companies rediscover their passion. Working with young people is where you find relevance in your work for the next generation. They spark a passion that always ignited us, and help businesses reconnect with that.”
Brake also states that the students benefit from the networking aspect inherent in community partnerships. “Students will develop pathways to careers locally, and get people to become their champions — people that will help them access college, internships and eventually, a career, if they build and maintain those connections.”
At OIA, those partnerships are an essential piece to students’ college and career readiness skills, valued so highly that school leadership lobbied the district to provide a part-time staff position to manage and grow community partnerships.  
“I was handling the curriculum and the duties that come with being principal, but I knew this piece was so important. We needed dedicated resources.” The school’s community partnerships liaison splits time between teaching special education and managing community relationships for OIA; many, who Benjamin cites, return each year to collaborate on projects. “We were fortunate to have a community that bought in from the very beginning, and now, they have someone they can contact, and say, ‘we want to get on board’.”
OIA’s successful community partnerships program includes the local headquarters of businesses like Southern Star Pipeline (who provide volunteer judges and help with the school’s robotics tournaments), Puzzle Pieces, a nonprofit dedicated to helping children and adults with disabilities (where students have donated 3D puzzles they’ve created for clients) and the Chamber of Commerce that connects students with business leaders in the area. 
The sustainable structure of OIA’s project-based learning academy is a result of years of hard work, dedicated leaders and community partners, and a commitment to working through a process that provides the best outcomes for its students. “You can’t just copy [a model] and think it’s going to work,” said Benjamin. “You have to work through the process. And we wouldn’t be where we are today without our community, and those relationships, along with our curriculum and the rigor that’s part of that. New Tech Network is definitely the one to credit for that.”

The campus's collective goal is to reduce food waste while increasing the distribution of healthy and financially available food to combat food insecurity. Part of our Agriculture curriculum is “Food Science” in Strand 7 where “learners apply principles of biology, chemistry, and physics to the research, development, production, processing, and distribution of food products meeting quality assurance standards in a system that is safe and secure.” One avenue Aiken teachers take to address this standard is with La 
Soupe and our roasting of coffee with La Terza. The other avenue is training  Ag Students to be GAP (Good Agriculture Practices) Certified.
