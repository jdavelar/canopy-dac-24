Education Evolving,24,Boston Day and Evening Academy,Roxbury,MASSACHUSETTS,Boston Day and Evening Academy Charter,No,,"Mission and Vision: Boston Day and Evening Academy re-engages off-track students in their education preparing them for high school graduation, post-secondary success and meaningful participation in their community. Boston Day and Evening Academy will continue to be an innovative leader in student-centered education for off-track learners. Highlights: Competency Based Education-  The primary--and the crucial difference between a competency-based system of teaching and assessment and a traditional model, is that students begin a learning pathway (traditionally referred to as middle school or high school) based on assessed skill level in each content area, and not on arbitrary placement in grades (based on age). Each content area (i.e. Humanities, Math, Science, Technology) is divided into modules, which correspond to an academic semester, quarter, or trimester (see ROADMAP). After being assessed for their knowledge in each content area, students are placed into the module which puts them at their ""learning edge"" i.e. challenging, but not overwhelming. Students progress from module to module in each content area, based on their ability to demonstrate mastery in each area, independently and multiple times. Once they meet the assigned benchmarks in each module, they become ""competent"", and move on to the next module. If they finish a trimester without demonstrating competency in an area, they repeat that module--and that module only--while moving ahead in other content areas. Innovative Teaching Practices In addition to using competency-based teaching and assessment practices to drive the curriculum and inform the learning that takes place at BDEA, faculty are constantly embracing new forms of teaching that address the student-centered nature of their work. Blended Learning- We are thoughtful about how we are using technology to enhance learning, and hear from students that they need a balance of technology and personalized, teacher-led instruction.  Our approach has been to create a blended learning model that combines a variety of options including online courses, as well as technology-supported classes enhanced by the use of iPads, Smartboards and computers.  We have a Personalized Online Learning Lab (POLL) where students can catch up on classroom work or accelerate their progress through classes. But the bottom line is always having teachers available for support, direction, and conversation. Experiential Learning- For over a decade, BDEA has included Project Month as a way of turning all classes ""experiential"", and giving students--and teachers--an opportunity to collaborate on projects that become an enduring part of the whole-school community.  One year, one of the projects turned an abandoned community clubhouse into a solar powered, hydroponic greenhouse. Another year, students engaged with the ""Occupy Boston"" movement and recreated the experience of tent living, media coverage, and the genesis of the Arab Spring in a series of connecting classrooms at the school.   Active Learning- Active Learning takes many forms, from the expected inclusion of physical fitness into the everyday experience of our staff and students, to the authentic learning experience that results from theatrical movement classes taught by valued partners Actors' Shakespeare Project.   Our partners at Project Adventure helped us to understand and incorporate important aspects of ""active"" learning into our teaching practice, coaching students to physically ""move through"" diagrams  instead of writing them on a whiteboard, and to use space rather than fill it.",Not sure,,They are in our network,"teacher-powered, student-centered",September 2020,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,250004901245

Anonymous,101,Impact | Puget Sound Elementary,Tukwila,Washington,Impact Public Schools,No,,"Impact | Puget Sound Elementary (PSE) is the flagship campus for Impact Public Schools, the first homegrown Washington state elementary charter network. After opening in 2018, Impact | PSE has proven that its model has the ability to narrow, and eventually close, the opportunity gap for historically marginalized students in south Puget Sound. Impact | PSE uses a model rooted in three design principles:  [1] Relationships: Fostering secure attachments within a tight-knit community of learners using a small group mentor model. [2] Agency: Working with families and students to develop comprehensive, personalized learning pathways for each individual scholar [3] Liberation: Creating deep, authentic learning experiences for students that lead to activism through the exploration of contextualized topics that are relevant in student' communities.  The Impact | PSE model employs an expanded definition of student success. While Core Skills are critical to student success, Impact | PSE also believes that deeper learning skills and social-emotional skills are essential to support the next generation of equity-driven, innovative leaders. These three design principles are the foundation for achieving this vision of student success.   Impact | PSE's implementation of a decolonized project-based learning (PBL) program is a stand-out element of the school model. The PBL curriculum has been designed to shift the dominant perspective and highlight voices, stories, and information that has not been emphasized in how students traditionally learn history. These projects lift up the indigenous perspective and work to break down institutional racism many educational systems continue to perpetuate. Impact | PSE operates with the belief that all scholars deserve to see themselves and their experiences reflected in what is being taught in their classrooms. All students deserve to learn about and be exposed to writers, artists, historians, community heroes and leaders who share their background and identity. In order for the Impact | PSE curriculum to be liberating, it must be rooted in the local communities it serves. At Impact | PSE, instructional leaders ensure that the liberated PBL model is replicable by developing a rigorous and relevant base curriculum that includes assessment tools, lesson plans and exemplars. Then, the school provides systems, structures (including a process for community/parent design input) and professional development to ensure the projects are rooted in the school community. This two-part method ensures that the curriculum is not rooted in the command, control and regurgitation of facts, but instead in the exploration of important, relevant questions that allow students to create real products and showcase them in front of a live audience of peers, parents and community members.",Yes,"Despite the obstacles and uncertainty that COVID-19 has imposed on schools and communities, Impact | Puget Sound Elementary remained committed to providing a first rate education for students and families.

One such innovation embraced by the school is that they have operated a community garden and farmer's market for the past several years.

Education Reimagined,266,Embark Education,Denver,COLORADO,n/a (independent),No,,"Founded on the integration of community into every learning opportunity young people encounter, this learning environment is a one-of-a-kind model that takes advantage of both the learning spaces that already exist in the community and the opportunity to build out new ones that will give back to the community served.  Embark's primary learning spaces currently include a learning hub, a coffee shop, and a bike shopâ€”all of which exist solely for the purpose of serving Embark's young learners. This socially embedded, open-walled design naturally challenges young people to continuously push beyond their social and emotional comfort zones. Baked into every learning experience is the opportunity for the learner to reflect on their successes and failuresâ€”resulting in an ever-evolving understanding of their sense of self.  Developing a sense of self is a primary learning outcome at Embark. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized experiences, this outcome is achieved with remarkable consistency. Take one young learner who was learning at Embark's coffee shop, Pinwheel Coffee.  One day, she became particularly curious about the espresso machineâ€”its inner workings and what made espresso so appealing to the shop's customers. Questions began flying left and right in her mind: â€œHow does this espresso machine work? How profitable is a single espresso drink? What do we charge for an espresso? Why do we charge that much? Should we charge that much? Should we charge more or less? Where do our coffee beans come from? Who is our source?â€  Rather than having to let these questions go unanswered, Embark's learner-centered environment provides the space and opportunity for a rich and robust exploration to unfold. The young learner sat down with a mentor and reviewed the coffee shop's financialsâ€”developing an understanding of the cost and revenue of each espresso order. Then, she was able to contact the vendors who supplied the coffee beans to better understand how they were sourced. Shortly after her research concluded, the coffee shop did adjust their prices, citing her work as a contributing factor to the changes made.  So, through one unimpeded and wide-ranging learning experience, she was able to dig into business finance, business ethics, local and international trade, and supply chain management. Whereas a conventional setting might allow her to touch on a few of these topics in isolated, time-restricted units, this young learner dove right into the complexity and overlap of each topic within a real business settingâ€”guided by her own burgeoning learner agency.  Embark's focus on letting young learners lead the way requires adult leaders to be ready at a moment's notice to support the growth and development of new learning journeys no matter how unexpected they might be. And, it is the unexpected that keeps everyone passionately engaged in their work, ready to discover what each new day has to offer.",Not sure,,Connected with Miguel Gonzalez,learner-centered education,September 2020,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,

Standard curriculums, siloed subjects, and age-based comparisons were never going to show up at Highlands. Instead, a competency-based culture of collaboration, community, and curiosity were going to drive the learning for each individual child.  The leaders at Highlands Micro School never asked if kids as young as four and five could develop a sense of learner agency. They knew it to be true based on the scientific evidence they had gathered, and they set out to prove the findings. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized learning, they have rewritten the story on what learners are capable of. There is no greater example than the young girl who proclaimed, â€œDandelions are the cure for cancer!â€  Rather than thinking, â€œthat's nice, honey,â€ her scientifically-minded mother and educators challenged her to prove it. And, off she went exploring scientific literature, utilizing her strengths as a writer, and creating a presentation for her community to assess her findings. Oh, by the way, this learner was five years old! And, she's one of many stories coming out of this socially embedded environment where every learner supports one another as they pursue their annual passion projects.  With an assessment framework that all but eliminates the ability to compare, learners aren't looking to compete with one another. They want to see everyone succeed and grow. Each learner is on a path to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that support their present and future yearnings, which are unimpeded by the individual interests of their peers.

Through this collaboration, students self-select into different roles.

Idaho STEM Action Center,322,North Idaho STEM Charter Academy,Rathdrum,IDAHO,North Idaho STEM Charter Academy,No,,"North Idaho STEM Charter Academy (NISCA) is unlike any other school in Idaho that I am aware of, in that it is almost solely focused on student academic success. By that I mean it doesn't offer busing or provide student lunches, there are no extracurricular activities - sports or otherwise - so students don't leave school early to attend away contests, and there are no assemblies to disrupt the regular school day. While at first glance this might seem to be somewhat grim, the concept appears to be quite successful as is evidenced by the fact that enrollment/demand continues to increase, students are exceedingly well prepared for college and career, staff turnover is minimal, and both parents and community partners are enthusiastic supporters of the school and its emphasis on STEM education.   With a very business-like orientation, students come to ""work"" from 8:00 to 4:00, Monday through Thursday and they all wear school-approved uniforms, are expected to have a strong work ethic, self discipline and are held accountable for the choices they make. Teachers do not accept late work from students at any grade level or in any subject area. Mornings are spent in traditional academic subjects, while every afternoon students are engaged in a variety of projects, both individually and in groups, to apply their learning. This model has allowed students at NISCA to excel in STEM to an unprecedented level for a small, rural school. Accomplishments include working with NASA to successfully launch a nano satellite and a trip to Washington DC to present to NASA engineers, senators and congressmen.

Because my former school and NEAAAT were both wall-to-wall PBL schools with a commitment to STEM and Design Thinking, we were able to develop a strong relationship of collaboration and sharing of ideas. I was finally able to visit the school in person in 2019 and through my interaction with students and staff, validated that this school is a true exemplar for how a school can use the assets of its community to completely shift the paradigm of high quality teaching and learning.","Service Learning, Business Advisory, Community Partnerships, STEM, Makerspace, PBL, Design Thinking",September 2020,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,370039403360
Anonymous,324,Northwest Passage High School,Coon Rapids,MINNESOTA,Northwest Passage High School,No,,"Focus on mindset and relevant learning over pure content. Their open-walled focus comes from their foundation as an experiential, project-based learning environment. Twenty times a year, young learners take part in overnight expeditions that, as exemplified by just one learner, can include state park backpacking trips, MAAP STARS Leadership retreats, YMCA Youth in Government experiences, an autism conference in Iowa, Women in Sciences expeditions to New Orleans, and more.  Expeditions out into the world are but one modality through which young people can make their learning personalized, relevant, and contextualized. When young learners aren't traveling, they are exploring their unique interests and passions on campus. Educators are trained to look for the â€œlittle gemsâ€ each of their learners leans intoâ€”like reading books or public speakingâ€”so they can integrate broader learning experiences through those modes of learning and expression.  While these interests and learning strategies are being discovered, learner agency is being built. NWPHS learners are expected to do far more than just obtain the credits and grades they need to graduate. Instead, they are given the space to learn who they are and how they can direct their own learning, which results in the creation of personalized learning plans. Each plan includes independent project ideas, seminars or workshops the young learner plans to attend, their expedition schedule, and personal goal statements. Overall, these plans show young people how they can take advantage of what's available to them here and now, rather than waiting for that next phase, be it college or career, where life supposedly begins.  A learner's self-confidence grows exponentially through NWPH's many supportive structures, including their focus on advisories. When a learner first steps foot inside NWPHS, they are welcomed by familiar faces each morning, creating a socially embedded culture that makes room for taking healthy risks and judgment-free failure. This culture allows learners to develop their personalized leadership styleâ€”enabling quiet leaders to lead through action and motivational leaders to make their contribution by handing out words of encouragement.",Not sure,,Connection with Peter Wieczorek,learner-centered education,September 2020,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,270017303041

They can imagine, design, and pursue learning pathways that are unique to their individual passions and engage in deeply personal learning experiences every day. Young learners (and their families) own the learning process.  From day one, families are enrolled through an intentional onboarding program. Family members explore and communicate their hopes and dreams for their kids, and the role they hope to play in seeing those dreams fulfilled. Young learners build a flexible learner profile that reveals their interests, aspirations, and challenges. With input from the whole family, a blueprint is created for connecting young learners with personalized, relevant, and contextualized opportunities.  In practice, this blueprint might land a young learner out in the community at a local food bank where socially embedded learning through conversations with staff, volunteers, and patrons is abundant. Within this open-walled experience, the young learner is deeply engaged in social, nutritional, and philanthropic studiesâ€”where the high-level, competency-based outcomes they develop carry over to whatever sparks the young learner's curiosity next.  Starting with general interests and passions rather than specific careers (or content standards) allows Odyssey learners (and their advisors) to gain exposure to once unknown possibilities. As they build their knowledge, skills, and dispositions within this learner-centered framework, they continuously develop a strong sense of learner agencyâ€”embracing their innate independence and leadership to explore what the world has to offer and how they can contribute to their community.  Learning at Odyssey meets every young learner where they are, which organically leads to a one-of-a-kind â€œrecipeâ€ of learning that is dynamic and palatable. All of this has been possible since their first year of operation, thanks to the unique combination of ingredients Odyssey leaders know makes for authentic and rich learning.

The district has plans to expand the program school-wide (K-8) in 2021-22.","At SPARK School at Kyrene de las Manitas, 120 students in multi-aged grade bands work with a core team of six educators: one teacher executive designer, three certified teachers and two resident teacher candidates.  Rather than having one assigned teacher for the year, students in the SPARK School benefit from a team of educators. The educator team is led by the teacher executive designer, a certified teacher leader. The core educator team includes three additional certified teachers and two resident teacher candidates. The core team's composition may vary from year to year depending on student and educator needs, interests and strengths. The educator team collaboratively designs curriculum and multidisciplinary projects, acting as guides who empower students as active learners and problem-solvers.  Community educators with content area expertise act as additional educator team members who contribute their expertise to SPARK students. For example, a mindfulness coach visits the learning environment three times weekly to work with students on yoga and cognitive strategies.  The instructional model of SPARK is built on experiential learning, with an emphasis on Project-Based Learning (PBL) and inquiry. Students explore interdisciplinary themes across content areas, and their PBL units cross curricular areas. Projects emerge from student interests and are aligned with Arizona state standards. The educator team has the autonomy to leverage district-adopted curricular resources selectively, choosing the resources that best align with their PBL units and the standards being addressed.  SPARK students learn at a pace that fits their individual needs and have opportunities to explore their interests during Genius Hour and core instructional time. Educators recognize the value of having students from different backgrounds and with varied academic strengths, working together. The program is not tracked and includes students with a range of academic and socio-emotional needs. Educators employ various approaches to accommodate the students.  The SPARK School team is led by a teacher executive designer. The district created this position, which includes an additional stipend, with the goal of retaining highly effective educators and building advancement pathways that keep educators working directly with students. The teacher executive designer is a highly experienced certified teacher who models instructional practices, coaches fellow educators and oversees curriculum design.

Transcend,366,Van Ness Elementary School,Washington,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,District of Columbia Public,No,,"We imagine a city â€“ and a nation â€“ where every child attends a school in which her or his well-being is a central priority. We imagine a nation where schools mitigate the negative effects of stress and trauma by establishing environments in which all students feel safe and loved and can develop the socio-emotional and academic skills they need to thrive.   Van Ness  Elementary School is building and testing a model that does just that.  Located in Ward 6 of the District of Columbia, Van Ness was closed in 2006 by DCPS due to under-enrollment but reopened after successful advocacy by neighborhood parents in 2015. Under the leadership of the founding Head of School, Cynthia Robinson-Rivers, Van Ness currently serves over 400 students  PK through 5th graders (ages 3-11 years old) and their families.  Van Ness serves a racially and socioeconomically diverse community of families in which approximately 51% of our students receive free or reduced lunch and 20% have special needs.   Over the past four years, Van Ness Elementary (a DC Public School) has focused on mitigating the negative effects of stress and trauma by creating learning environments in which all students feel safe and loved, and where they can develop the socio-emotional and academic skills they need to thrive. The result, the â€œStudent Well-being Model,â€ is rooted in the understanding that children's academic success is connected to their overall well-being. Rooted in the latest research in child development and learning, after four years of design, testing, and redesign, the Student Well-being Model has evolved into three unique but integrated sub-parts:    CARE (Compassion-Assertiveness-Relationships-Environment) creates a safe and predictable classroom community where students feel valued, learn to self-regulate, and work in ways that help them meet individual and class goals. It consists of whole-class rituals for the start of the day and for transitions, classroom structures, a set of teacher moves to foster relationships, and a safe and predictable classroom environment and design.   BOOST recognizes that approximately 5-10% of our students need a â€œboostâ€ in order to feel safe, build trusting relationships, and learn to self-regulate. Boost is a set of evidence-based interventions that classroom teachers can use directly, proactive group therapies, and individual interventions based on an analysis of the function of a child's behavior and history of trauma.   The final element of Student Well-being is to create a FAMILY CIRCLE composed of a student's school and home family. Grounded in the belief that close partnership with and active engagement from families is critical if we are to support a child's full development, school leaders and faculty conduct home visits with every student, communicate regularly with families through individual texts and class newsletters, partner with parents on academics, and hold parent events that foster community and teach strategies for how to support students at home.  In the school-year 2019-2020,  Van Ness spread the Student Well-being Model to 5 DCPS schools through the newly created Whole Child Collaborative (WCC).  This year, each school piloted the model in at least 2 classrooms and this fall each plan to roll-out the model to the full school. In addition, given the collective trauma created by COVID-19, this summer, Van Ness created easy-to-access implementation tools that allow schools to select and implement the model's SEL practices and mental health supports.  These resources will include a clear description of how each strategy connects to and supports the stressors and traumas students and families are currently facing as well as outline how each strategy",Yes,"As schools reopen, we know that they will need to address the trauma their students and families have experienced.

With this open-walled take on a central learning hub, they are able to provide daily, immersive learning experiences that draw from and draw out learner' unique passions, interests, and curiosities. With young learners at the center of Verdi EcoSchool's design, powerful learning opportunities crop up in the most unexpected ways.  For example, while exploring their community, a group of young learners came to their advisor with a keen observation. The trail featured many plaques celebrating historical figures and their contributions to the area. But, they were all older, white men. The young learners, who did not see themselves or their culture in Melbourne's history, wanted to know what contributions people of color and women made toward the growth and development of the city.  In this moment, they were calling for a personalized, relevant, and contextualized experience and exercising their learner agency by owning their learning journey, rather than being passive participants.  This marked the beginning of a long-term project that, thanks to Verdi EcoSchool's competency-based framework, was seen as an entirely relevant learning opportunity. It fit perfectly inside their place- and nature-based learning philosophy.  Along the way, these young learners were fully immersed within a socially embedded context where peers, advisors, and community members were all seen as learning partners. The knowledge, skills, and dispositions these young learners cultivated during their preliminary research on Melbourne's history was just the tip of the iceberg for where they wanted to take things next. Once they discovered the story of Zora Neale Hurstonâ€”a prominent Black female literary figureâ€”they wanted to figure out how the community could honor her legacy.",Not sure,,Connected with Ayana Verdi,learner-centered education,September 2020,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,

Here is how I tried to summarize the school for a short description, not long ago:  Waring encourages, enables and affirms each student's love of learning, the innate search for knowledge, the development of skills, and individual expression. At the Individual Learner level, that means: â€¢	Active, rigorous, inquiry-based, idea-oriented teaching and learning across integrated curriculum areas (seminars, labs, projects, writing, visual and performing arts) â€¢	Student-centered, personal agency-building (competency-based progression, TA program, Innovative Focus/Flex Periods) â€¢	Deep and authentic learning relationships: student to student, student to faculty, faculty to faculty â€œI am a curious, thoughtful, lifelong learner.â€  At the Level of an Engaged, Diverse Community of Learners: Waring mindfully builds a robust, caring and respectful community around a shared ethic. â€¢	Mixed-age structures and opportunities (tutorials, all-school meeting, camping trip, Endterms, Teaching Assistantship and Peer Mentoring programs) â€¢	Community-wide shared experiences (French language and culture, athletics, performing arts, science fair, travel) â€¢	Meaningful cultural dialogue based on a diversity of identity and ideas â€¢	Trust and personal responsibility as the primary operating principles â€œI am a collaborative, respectful person who earns the trust of others.â€  And (largest circle), in how Waring encourages a life of purpose at the school and beyond: Waring sees and thinks about our place in the world, preparing students to value cultural diversity, envision and build a productive, fulfilling life, and to make a difference for the better. â€¢	Learning in service to society, both locally and globally â€¢	Cultural proficiency & competency working in diverse teams â€¢	Intellectual tolerance and social unity â€œI can find shared meaning in a diverse world.â€ â€œI can add to the lives of others.â€ â€œI can lead through change.â€",Not sure,,Our three daughters attended and graduated from the school.

Vermont Agency of Education,389,Central Vermont Career Center,Barre,Vermont,Barre Unified Union School District,Yes,,"As a local control state, when Vermont transitioned to proficiency based graduation requirements, each school district was left to develop its own specific requirements, informed by resources provided by the Agency of Education. Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion.",Not sure,,"I am the State Director of Career and Technical Education and work closely with all 16 regional technical centers.

Educators believe an integrated approach is the â€œbest fit'' for meeting targets. Project-based learning (PjBL) is one strategy used for integrating content. Although there are currently PjBL â€œislands of excellenceâ€ in science and world language, implementing this approach holds the potential for growth in the future.   Proficiency-driven opportunities highlight learning thatâ€¯isâ€¯personalized and learning environments that are flexible. FWSU's goal is to ensure that their students receive a â€œfuture-ready, world-class educationâ€ and graduate with the knowledge and skills to successfully pursue their goals.    Bellows Free Academy (BFA), the supervisory union high school, has been leading this work and providing guidance for the elementary schools. Outcome proficiencies cut across all four years of high schools with performance indicators being used to determine proficiency. Educators are refining common assessments and provide different pathways for students to achieve expected outcomes. The principal of BFA is a master at developing a schedule with blocks of varying amounts of time to create a learning environment that is responsive to the needs of learners. There is a comprehensive approach to supporting students. Educators know their students deeply and create a culture that is connected and authentic.   Performance assessments in grades eight and ten prepare students for a capstone project in twelfth grade. There are also pathways to distinction that are available which are personalized according to a student's interest. This opportunity â€œignites a fireâ€ for some students.  BFA administrators and staff have been engaged in learning and having conversations about equity for several years. Last spring, while on dismissal, racial justice became a  part of their student's world. School had ended for the summer, but leadership knew they couldn't wait for the fall to connect with students about this important issue. A group of teachers decided to put out an open invitation to have a discussion about what was going on in the world and how to move forward together. Around a dozen students joined the first zoom session. They asked questions about the return to school and other topics before the conversation shifted to equity and racial justice in their school. At first, the teachers facilitated the conversation, but somewhere in the middle of the summer, the students took over the agenda and the conversation. Their goal was to provide opportunities for the student body to join the conversation about racial justice in their school and in the world, and ultimately improve the culture of BFA. Thus, the Fairfax Racial Justice  Alliance (RJA) began. Since the start of the school year, students have been exposed to the four agreements and the compass from Courageous Conversations. They have had discussions about equity using case studies that explore socio-economic, cultural and racial bias, and equity. Work in advisory complements the goals of the BFA Fairfax  RJA.   Additionally, an early warning system approach is in place to examine if certain students are being marginalized. Educators recognize the importance of confronting evidence about which students are historically privileged, and which are not. This process is strengthening practices to support all learners. Both the student and the system levels are being analyzed to determine where inequities exist and how to implement change.

Vermont Agency of Education,393,Randolph Union High School,Randolph,Vermont,Orange Southwest Unified School District,No,,"Randolph Union Middle/High School is designing for equity through the implementation of ongoing equity-focused professional development in the form of Professional Learning Communities. Faculty meet regularly in small groups to discuss current equity issues in the school and wider community, explore solutions, examine implicit bias, and to research and develop different curricular and pedagogical resources. These PLC groups provide a means through which to foster a culture of continuous equity learning amongst faculty, as well as a space to process personal experiences with inequity and bias. As part of RU's regularly scheduled professional development, the PLC structure is supporting faculty in developing equity as a lens through which to approach teaching and learning.  As part of this ongoing professional development, RU developed a set of social justice standards adapted from those published by Teaching Tolerance, called the Democratic Engagement Standards. These standards provide a structure through which teachers can design learning experiences that ask students to grapple with issues related to identity, equity, and structural injustice. RU is currently in the pilot year of using these standards, working towards identifying places in the curriculum that already provide opportunities to address these topics, in addition to places where these standards and topics could be further developed. As the Democratic Engagement Standards are not content-area specific, and can be integrated into any subject area, RU is actively working towards incorporating this essential work in classes beyond just the humanities.  The equity-focused PLC program also works to foster a culture of anti-racist action, encouraging teachers to collaboratively address systemic inequities in the school building. Student activism is encouraged and supported through project-based learning opportunities. Students organized and hosted the first ever state-wide student conference on racial justice in the Spring of 2019, bringing together students and activists from across Vermont.

Hazen is committed to heterogenous grouping allowing students to choose an academic path best suited to their learning goals where each student selects a program reflecting their individual interests, abilities, and needs.  Hazen Union recently piloted a student-centered driven, student-designed, advanced manufacturing course and makerspace using student personalized learning plans (PLPs) as a tool for students to co-design and co-develop curriculum with teachers and community partners. This pilot expanded upon Hazen's well-established Work-Based Learning (WBL) Program and Independent Based Learning (IBL) Program. In response to COVID-19, Hazen Union and community partners leveraged the grant funded equipment to print face shields for Vermont doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The community partners worked with the students virtually throughout the process, providing opportunities to engage in design-thinking methods and skill attainment that could be applied across contexts. Upon completion of the pilot, the student cohort presented their curriculum, reflections, and deliverables to OSSU School Board members with recommendations to support the sustainability of this program. Students were empowered to demonstrate their competency in communication, advocacy, and action research in order to maintain this student-centered program for their peers. The success of this program conveys the importance of education and community partnerships and the positive impact student voice has within the school system and the community at large. This year, the program has tripled in size with the support of community partnerships.

Anonymous,395,Missisquoi Valley Union Middle and High School,Swanton,Vermont,Missisquoi Valley School District,No,The middle and high school is part of a larger school district.,"The leadership team at Missisquoi Valley Union (MVU) Middle and High School was able to hold two preliminary meetings and a train-the-trainer workshop focused on equity literacy with Paul Gorski. All members of the MVU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (DEI) Committee have a solid understanding of the principles and practices of equity literacy in education.  Educators from Swanton and Sheldon were intensively introduced to these principles and practices.  At MVU, several members of the DEI Committee feel fully prepared to plan and offer equity literacy professional learning to the staff. Additionally, an equity student survey was created, and feedback provided by the Equity Literacy Institute.  Educators secured funding to get the results of the survey professionally analyzed through an equity lens.   MVU has met the expectation of Proficiency-Based Learning with a thoughtful transition.  Early work was done 7 years ago to prioritize standards and create clear learning expectations, learning scales for common summative assessments, and school-wide habits of work.  Over the past 4 years, educators have implemented a more refined version of proficiency-based learning which includes a transition to proficiency-based grades, personalized course offerings, and robust and flexible â€˜keeping up and catching up' interventions.  As a highlight, the English Language Arts department has wholeheartedly embraced independent reading.  Students now meet their reading proficiencies by providing evidence from books that they choose.  Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: â€¢	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. â€¢	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. â€¢	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: â€¢	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. â€¢	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. â€¢	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: â€¢	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. â€¢	Begin Equity student focus groups. â€¢	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. â€¢	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. â€¢	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. â€¢	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL's 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.  MVU is in its 4th year of working with Think: Kids and using the Collaborative Problem-Solving approach with students.

Anonymous,398,Sam Houston Collegiate Preparatory Academy,Midland,Texas,Midland Independent School District,No,,"Sam Houston is in year 1 of implementing the Third Future Schools model, which has completely changed the culture of the school and opportunities for students. The model focuses on personalized learning and direct instruction with a focus on meeting more than solely academic needs.   Personalized learning is an approach to instruction that is centered on the student. It taps into a student's needs, strengths, and interests to engage students and to provide a â€œbest fitâ€ education for each student. The instruction is tailored to the individual needs of the student, and students learn in a way that best meets their learning style. Third Future's personalized learning program features four distinguishing characteristics: 1. Learner Profile is a summary of the student's academic history, strengths, interests, social-emotional needs, and how he learns best. It is developed with the student and the parents in order to let the school know how to provide a tailored education that meets the individual student's needs and goals. 2. Student Learning Plan is the individualized, academic plan that will enable the student to reach academic proficiency and meet his other learning goals. It outlines the part of a student's curriculum that will be taught directly and the activities and lessons that will be customized for the student. 3. Flexible Learning Environment allows students to have a more tailored schedule and allows the teacher to use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction. Students may receive some instruction in a large group (25 students) or work in a small group, with a partner, or by himself. With the help of technology, and because the doors of the school will be open from 6:30 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., students may also learn before school, after school, or at home. 4. Competency-Based Education allows students to learn at their own pace. If a student has already mastered an objective or standard, they can move on to accelerated objectives or to a topic related to their other learning goals. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, she can take more time and received more individualized or small group instruction.   Third Future is also implements the ""dyad"" concept that establishes requirements for experiences that are often only available to students with means, such as participating in sports, learning an instrument, traveling, and more. Third Future provides these experiences to students who are not able to afford them.   Students in the upper grades at Sam Houston also take a course called The Art of Thinking. To my knowledge, Third Future Schools spend the most time on teaching critical thinking and informational literacy, which is so critical to our current society.   Finally, Sam Houston is currently open from 6:30-4:30 (and even later outside of the current pandemic), which provides families free before and after school care.

When they realized COVID-19 was going to monumentally shift education models, they pivoted and created their COVID response plan. I3 Academy teammates consulted with local Department of Health and CDC leaders to create the i3 Safe for Me COVID-19 Response plan. The tenants of the plan include increased hygiene and social distancing measures, extreme flexibility of learning, and strong communication between the school and families. We are a couple of months into school, and our model is working. Students have adapted to wearing their face covering in-person and remote learning when not on campus.

Arkansas Team Digital,407,Batesville Junior High School,Batesville,Arkansas,Batesville School District,No,,"Overall, BJHS is relatively new to implementing blended learning, so for this school year, what stands out the most is the commitment to being flexible and providing multiple educational avenues for students that have allowed parents and students to select a learning environment that provides security and safety, but also provides a quality educational experience for our students. Teachers have moved to use Google Classroom as the primary interface with students. The Batesville School District has allowed students to choose between 3 different learning environments this school year, based on the parent and student preference. Most of our students are in person or remote, which for BJHS means the student is joining a physical classroom via Google Meet from an alternate location. This allows the student to take part in classroom discussions and have access ""real-time"" to a teacher but doing so from the safety of their location of choice.  As far as doing things differently, BJHS is a one to one school. All students are issued a Chromebook, and the vast majority of our curriculum is provided via a digital format. Because BJHS had chosen to go one to one a few years ago, the staff and students were already in a situation to pivot to off-site learning when COVID struck our area. Though there were issues to resolve, our district was in a strong position to roll out digital learning to students. When this school year began, all students were given 3 options regarding how they would receive their education. Students were given the option of attending in person, attend ""remotely"" (which is described above), or attending virtually.   Virtual instruction at BJHS consisted of students accessing courseware via Edgenuity or Lincoln Learning and working at their own pace.  This provided our families and students the ability to select the learning option that best suited their needs. There is no other district in our geographic area that I am aware of that provided this many students' options.",Yes,"The willingness to be respectful of our stakeholders, families, and students' concerns regarding COVID while tailoring a unique educational opportunity for each of our students.

Learning Policy Institute,409,Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High,Los Angeles,California,Los Angeles Unified,No,,"Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School, located in Boyle Heights in East LA, is a full-service community school that places its students and their futures at the heart of its equity-oriented vision. Mendez operated as a community school long before it became one of the first members of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Community School cohort in 2019. This means that the school prioritizes the four pillars of a community school: integrated student supports (wraparound services), extended learning time and opportunity, distributed leadership, and family and community engagement. Students understand that their wellbeing is at the heart of the school's mission. In 2019, 85% of students reported feeling safe at Mendez and 81% of students reported that they are happy to be at Mendez (LAUSD School Experience Survey, 2019). At Mendez, student learning is also a priority, and the school's graduation rates have risen dramatically in the ten years since its founding in 2009. The school began with a graduation rate of nearly 50% and now has a graduation rate of over 84%, 90% of whom go to college.  As part of the school's focus on integrated student supports, Mendez High School partners with a number of different community organizations that provide services to students and their families. These community partners fulfill different roles on campus and can engage in case management, put on whole-school events, and offer group supports. Individual case management organizations, like Promesa Boyle Heights or Communities in Schools LA, provide one-on-one supports to students and families, often targeting dropout prevention and academic engagement through mental health supports or other interventions. The school also recently broke ground on a Wellness Center, where it will be able to provide mental and physical health resources to the Boyle Heights community. This Wellness Center is the result of over 10 years of organizing by the school and its community partners.   The school also holds high academic expectations for its students and launched two initiatives that target student learning gains: AP for All and Computer Science for All. As part of these initiatives, all Mendez students take at least one AP course and at least one Computer Science course prior to graduation. Many students choose to continue taking AP and Computer Science courses once they are exposed to the experience. Teachers and parents were concerned at the outset of the AP for All initiative that students would all choose to take AP Spanish, as the student population is predominantly Latino/a/x and there is a higher proportion of English Learners at Mendez than there are across the district and statewide. And yet, students have demonstrated an interest in a variety of AP courses since the initiative began. The school also focuses on the needs of students with disabilities and uses an inclusion model to ensure that students with special needs are given the same opportunities to learn as their peers.   Mendez's principal, Mauro Bautista, models a culture of distributed leadership. This is reflected in many of the aspects of the school, including its multiple governing bodies that include a variety of stakeholders throughout the community. There is a School Site Council, Local School Leadership, the School Culture Committee, the Family Action Team, and the House of Student Representatives. Many of the initiatives that are currently central to Mendez's approach are the result Principal Bautista seeking feedback from educators and families to guide decisions, including the school's Restorative Justice, Computer Science for All, and AP for All initiatives, which were all started by Mendez teachers.  The school has a hands-on approach to family and community engagement, which it leveraged when the pandemic closed LAUSD schools. Mendez staff and community partners reached out to every student and family, and if they could not contact anyone they did home visits. At these home visits, they provided an array of services, including delivering food or supplies and providing mental health check-ins. They also leveraged these relationships with families to determine how to deliver instruction in the Fall of 2020. Teachers, families, and students came together over the summer to determine the master schedule in the fall. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. They began planning for hybrid learning, where students will be on-campus part-time and their instruction will be aligned across the virtual and in-person learning environments.  Being on Mendez's campus is a joyful experience. Students whom you speak with readily share their learning, parents are frequently on campus volunteering or taking classes at its Family Center, and school leaders like Principal Bautista are often wandering the halls or working in the library because they both want to be accessible to the community and because they probably gave their office away to a community partner who is visiting campus. I'm excited to nominate Mendez because it is truly a community-based initiative that puts social and racial justice at the center of its decisions, which are all in service of the bright future of its students.",Yes,"When schools shuttered in March, Mendez staff began tracking who wasn’t logging into classes and to reached out to them over email, phone, and any other means possible. If they could not reach a student or family, they organized a home visit to understand what was going on. In addition to tech issues, they found that their families were often struggling with food insecurity or needed basic necessities like toilet paper. They engaged their community partners to provide these resources, and required all families to pick up devices, hot spots, and even furniture from the school to ensure students are set up to be successful in their virtual learning. The school has also engaged family, student, and teacher feedback to determine the schedule for the Fall and Spring, including family and extracurricular programming. Mendez created a subcommittee that was open to members of the school community to help determine what the schedule would look like in the Fall during online learning. They chose a quarter system so...","I've organized a site visit there to share the school's work as an exemplary community school and I've also interviewed teachers, community partners, school leaders, families, and students as part of our COVID response research.","community schools, family engagement/empowerment",November 2020,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,062271012438

Fielding International,427,Eden Park Elementary School,Cranston,Rhode Island,Cranston Public Schools,No,,"Cranston Public Schools (CPS) is an average-sized American public school district of twenty-two schools that serve an economically and ethnically diverse population.  Cranston is the third-largest city in Rhode Island, and typical of most American cities, most of its schools were built in the 1950s and '60s. Despite the advanced age of many schools in the District, CPS leadership proclaimed that ""we must go beyond warm, safe and dry."" We had just completed a comprehensive school facility plan, reinventing and reimagining Cranston's schools for the new twenty years and beyond. When approached by CPS District leadership to identify a potential â€œPathfinderâ€ or demonstration project, the Eden Park School presented a golden opportunity.   The School has a very progressive Principal and a teaching staff that was ready to reimagine and redefine their roles as teachers by letting go of the assumptions of what used to be school. They have fully embraced project-based learning and the five stages of finding a solution, real-time collaboration, and a flexible schedule to match their learning environment' flexibility.   Eden Park Learning Community is an ensemble of student-centered collaborative spaces. Moving away from the one teacher, one room, and sole care of one group of students, it is an environment that supports learner-agency, transparent technology, and fosters a wide variety of teaching and learning situations. These situations range from small group and independent study to whole group instruction or one-on-one with a teacher. The spaces also emphasize the importance of teacher collaboration by deprivatizing the planning process and include workspaces that allow teachers to work both independently and collaboratively.  The adoption of the Learning Community model at Eden Park has brought more flexibility and variety in day-to-day learning activities.  The old corridor was absorbed into the Learning Commons, leading to an agile space that supports multiple ways of learning, and multiple groups of learners.  This type of shared commons created a diffuse distribution of students and collaborative work areas.  Transparency between Learning Studios and the Commons facilitates interdisciplinary PBL learning for kids, adults, and folks who push-into these spaces for special services. The teachers have embraced industry experts and community partnerships in every way. Industry partners now plan with teachers, launch projects, and are utilized for feedback throughout each stage in the problem-solving process.   Teacher professional development through FI is embedded into the fabric of their work. Cranston is involved in ongoing professional development, which includes a three-year teacher coaching program. Teachers develop mastery in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum. Each year, the program becomes more student-centered, with learners identifying and defining problems and projects themselves by year three.   The results are in: at the 3rd-5th Grade Learning Community at the Eden Park School, the first completed, the level of engagement, personalization and physical comfort has reduced absences, seen a huge drop in disciplinary issues, and all but eliminated the need for specialized isolation and decompression rooms for students with special needs--instead, they are thriving within a suite of spaces shared by everyone in their learning community.

Anonymous,471,Woodstock Union Middle/High School,Woodstock,Vermont,Windsor Central Unified Union School District,No,,"The Windsor Central leadership team began the process of developing a Portrait of a Graduate and related strategic plan during the 2018-2019 school year. This effort allowed students, parents, educators, and community members in the newly formed Windsor Central Modified Unified Union District to collectively construct a vision of their graduates and a plan for enabling learners to meet those expectations. The strategic plan that was developed provides a clear roadmap with the Portrait of a Graduate being their â€œnorth star.â€ Leadership recognized the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in a meaningful process to achieve positive change. I was fortunate to be able to attend sessions and observe the high-level of commitment by all involved.   A systems perspective is also evident in Windsor Central's strategic plan through intentional connections between strategies and the Portrait of a Graduate competencies. For instance, Strategy 1.2 states, â€œAchieve a high level of math proficiency for all students through curriculum review, classroom instructional practices, professional development, and robust interventions so that all students reach their full potential.â€ The related Portrait Competency, Academic Excellence, is identified in order to ensure coherence between strategies and competencies.   At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects. This â€œTeacher's Toolkitâ€ is aimed at providing strategies for fostering skills and dispositions within the PoG. It was developed by educators as a resource to bring the PoG to life in classrooms. The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  â—	Create a culture of â€œDeep Learningâ€ in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; â—	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; â—	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; â—	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; â—	Develop a list of â€œinstructional lensesâ€;  â—	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  â—	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpack' tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them. Place-based learning supports the development of a sense of wonder, grows student' social-emotional skills, increases engagement, and builds a better understanding of the world.   Windsor Central Unified Union School District has engaged in racial equity work with the support of Writing Wrongs, LLC. The Windsor Central School Board's anti-racist work is focused on creating anti-racist policy. They have received a grant to dig further into current anti-racist efforts, starting with school board members and leadership within the system. An equity audit will be used to gather data regarding the current status.   The Leadership Team commits to adopting a more visible stance of active listening, collective learning, internal reflection, and critical evaluation of current practice. This stance and any action plans will be developed with the help of partnerships with individuals and organizations centered on this work to expose systemic racism embedded in our educational system. Leadership commits to providing students with an education that is explicitly anti-racist and refuses to turn away from the hard truths of our history.",Yes,"For families interested in keeping their children home for the 2020-21 school year, there is an option for learning off-campus, full-time for all students K-12.

Winooski’s GXs are Communication, Culture & Community, Critical Thinking, Creativity, Persistence, and Wellbeing. Together, they form the foundation of Winooski’s proficiency-based learning system, upon which our Graduate Proficiencies (GPs) begin to take shape. Students demonstrate graduation proficiency in each GX area through a capstone experience. Capstones serve as a culmination of student work in a GX area, giving students an opportunity to show the Winooski community the growth and learning they have done over an extended period of time within the domain of a GX. These complex performance assessments are evaluated by a team of teachers during Expo in January or June to determine their demonstrated proficiency.","Beginning in 2011, the Winooski Schools embarked on a mission to redesign our educational program to better reflect the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. We were awarded a 6-year grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation that funded opportunities for teacher growth as innovators and leaders, one-to-one technology, and an outreach effort that extended into the community's living rooms and conference rooms to ask â€œWhat do our students need to succeed?â€  The answers to that question were distilled into our six Graduate Expectations, or GXs: Communication, Critical Thinking, Culture & Community, Creativity, Persistence, and Wellbeing. Currently, students demonstrate the first two in order to graduate, with all required by 2022. Each is assessed through a multi-stage performance-based assessment and final demonstration of learning during our Expo Weeks in January and June. Students are also assessed for graduation in 19 academic proficiency areas and through skill tests in reading and mathematics.

MiCoOp,475,Link Learning,Berrien Springs,Michigan,Berrien Springs Public Schools,No,,"There are many reasons I am excited to nominate Link Learning, but the main reasons are their partnerships with schools around the state and how they use their data to improve student learning. Link Learning partners with brick and mortar schools that have exhausted their options for students who need a personalized learning plan and individual support. While most of these students are at-risk, Link Learning also serves the non-traditional learner like homeschoolers, professional high school athletes, students with unique medical conditions, youth in the justice system, and early parents. Students take just one or two courses at a time. Even though Link Learning is a virtual school, they have learning centers around the state for students to come and learn in a welcoming, supportive environment. Their partnership with the brick and mortar schools also allow their students to take seated courses.   Link Learning uses a tool to manage student engagement and progress. The program was developed in partnership with a software development company and their district, including virtual teachers. It automatically collects data from their LMS and records their staff interactions to get a whole-child view of each student. Within this system, they have the ability to see where a student falls in MTSS so they can intervene more quickly. The data is reviewed daily by teachers, weekly by learning center directors, and monthly by the quality assurance team (who support staff professional learning). Their data shows that the more intentional the teacher-student conversations, the more students are engaged, and the greater their academic achievement. These intentional conversations focus on helping students understand their role in learning, making a plan to fit education into their lives, and reflecting on their progress.   There is also a heavy focus on social-emotional learning. The school has staff specifically assigned to EL students, 13 special education staff, and social workers who work with students and staff. Relationships are built between students, staff, and parents to develop a community where they all feel they belong. Professional learning for staff includes shifting mindsets. First, they must understand that getting at-risk students to enroll is a success in itself. Once enrolled, they need to create connections and relationships so they are taught how to talk and relate to students. After relationships are built and students start engaging, they can focus conversations on learning such as time on task, number of days in class, and what they did when they were successful. The staff also works with students to help them self-regulate with the goal for them to become effective members of society.",No,,Their district is part of the MiCoOp which I facilitate.

MiCoOp,478,West Michigan Virtual Academy,Battle Creek,Michigan,Berrien Springs Public Schools,Yes,,"Not many virtual schools offer a drop-in center for middle school students. West Michigan Virtual Academy (WMVA) serves middle and high school students, grades 6-12. When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around student' social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.  Their drop-in center is located at the city's recreation center so WMVA has the ability to offer their virtual lifetime fitness classes with an in-person component. They also offer optional career field trips and guest speakers for all 300 students.
