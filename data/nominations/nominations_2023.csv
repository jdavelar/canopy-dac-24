With the COVID pandemic in 2020, BLPS soon realized they would need to dig deeper into the development and implementation of learning pathways to support all learners. Concerned about learning loss when virtual school was the only option, teachers engaged in professional collaboration to address those learning gaps. Prioritizing standards in ELA and Mathematics was a first step in the construction of an equitable viable Learning Continuum, where progressions of learning and readiness assessments were developed for the standards. As teachers continued to collaborate in both grade level and vertical teams, it was clear the curriculum work they had done served a larger purpose than addressing learning gaps – it had in fact provided an opportunity to foster agency in all learners! Date tracking and goal setting soon belonged to the 4- and 5-year-old kindergartners, first and second graders, and progress monitoring and celebrations of learning soon followed, where the outcome was student ownership of the learning! Generative curriculum, where the youngest of learners bring ideas to school about what they want to learn taps into curiosity and has made room for projects that are truly learner-centered at BLPS.

Key in the shift is a focus on mastery learning and an expectation of student success – no matter what it takes. Three years ago, a small group of teachers and the principal began studying and applying standards-based grading principles. Today, over 60 percent of the staff participate. The shift has evolved into equitable systems of grading and assessment across the campus, resulting in student agency and ownership of the learning. Students know the vision is for them to attain the highest level of proficiency/mastery. If they don’t succeed on the first attempt, they’ll have choice and opportunity to reassess. The staff believes that all students can succeed, and they insist on rigor by not allowing them to fail. Students own their learning and share their data with parents in regular emails. Collaboration, project-based learning, and flexible seating environment enable learners to flourish academically. 

Developing leadership and ensuring voice are critical at Cibola. The Courtesy Corps of student leaders in each classroom greet visitors and explain the focus of the day’s learning. Administration ensures student voice shapes the school culture. For example, a student focus group will roll out the new Portrait of a Graduate to the student body and provide ideas on systems to embed the POG in Cibola daily life. Adult agency has grown from teachers learning from teachers (TLFT). Teachers lead professional learning opportunities, participate in peer-to-peer classroom observations and feedback loops, and choose their personal learning pathways to grow their practice. Leaders provide time and support for the adult learning; as a result, teachers completed 82 digital PCBL learning modules in November. The Culture and Climate at Cibola High School has purposefully shifted. Staff believes that all students can succeed, and the focus is on developing the “whole student”, with student growth being the priority.

Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship,660,One World Middle School,"Bronx, New York",New York,NYC Department of Education,"As a school community, One World Middle School has reimagined the learning of what education looks like in how students experience school as a whole. At the foundational core, they believe that students have the right to a quality and innovative standards-based education, the right to know and be known in a safe and welcoming environment, and the right to be acknowledged as unique individuals who learn differently. These core beliefs promote and advance equity and student-centered learning throughout the school. It is evident upon walking through the halls, the classrooms, and interacting with the students that their core beliefs live and breathe through how they view the purpose of education and the instructional core, and the structures they deem important.
 

 One World Middle School has proven that in order to have a reimagined equitable learning environment, two components must be in place: a safe learning environment and a staff that knows who the children are and their individual needs. To support this idea they have implemented practices and events such as Ambassador Day, Unit 0, and Developing the Whole Child Meeting (DWC). Ambassador Day is quite the experience as students across all grades are given the opportunity to select their mentors for the year. During this particular day, students engage in community-building activities by spending the entire day in small groups with their teacher mentor discussing their commonalities and differences and learning to embrace each other diversity and strengths. Throughout the year the mentors meet weekly to plan and conduct themed-based activities. For example, in November and December, mentor groups coordinate events and activities around gratitude and acts of kindness respectively. These student-led initiatives have taken different forms over the years from groups creating donation drives, reading to students at neighborhood elementary schools, making edible treats that are distributed to fellow peers, volunteering at Senior Health Centers to simply redesigning a classroom space. 
 

 In thinking about how to continually engage students and to make sure all learners see themselves in the curriculum, One World Middle School acknowledges and celebrates the various cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity that comprises the school community through their first unit of the year. One World Middle School in all grades and content areas uses the first unit of the year which is called Unit 0 to focus on student identity and understanding the child. In addition, there are weekly meetings programmed called Developing the Whole Child (DWC) where teacher teams create action plans for ambassadors who may need support academically, socially, or emotionally. These strategies are often grounded in the Pre-referral Intervention Manual (PRIM) or Adaptation for Adolescents with Autism and Asperger's manual (A-5) to tailor the support to effectively meet the needs of the student. The teams continually discuss the outcomes of the strategy with each other as well including the student for their input. Teams reflect on progress as they monitor the impact on student learning.  
 

 At One World it is evident that they are thoughtful about the language they use with their students and in their space. It is a common belief that the process for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that equitably supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults begins with language which is clearly intertwined in the fabric of the school. The school truly believes that the words students encounter on daily basis, they will in turn embody. Thus, students are addressed as ambassadors because they are encouraged and provided with opportunities to be agents of change. The word ambassador coincides with the school's construction as they operate under a United Nations model where ambassador voices are influential in the way the school functions and the changes that occur. An example of a system in place is the school's embassy delegates which include members from all grades that meet biweekly with the principal. These meetings range from discussing issues and making suggestions, to planning events such as LGBTQ Coming Out Day, Autism Awareness Day, or Breast Cancer Awareness Day which is driven by the consensus of the student body. These student-centered planned events foster a level of self and others. Every morning during morning assembly the school gathers together to proclaim as one voice, ""I want today to be one of the greatest days of my life"" to establish a positive feeling and tone for the day. As a mantra, to work and live by, the school leadership believes and promotes that each year they must create a learning environment and community that is more impactful than the previous year. 
 

 It is without a doubt, that the ambassador's academic outcome is at the core of One World Middle School's instructional focuses and practices. They have demonstrated that ambassadors learn best when they have an opportunity to collaborate with peers and then make their thinking visible. Practices in place to support that students constantly engage with other students start with the structure of how the room is designed. At One World all classes are designed to accommodate a variety of grouping configurations. These configurations support opportunities over the course of a lesson for ambassadors to engage in turn and share and work on group assignments as well as projects in a seamless manner. Teachers have collaborated on phased protocols to promote partner discussions. As a best practice, all classrooms are equipped with two certified teachers to ensure that on a daily basis all needs of their children are met. Teachers take a less active role in talking in the classroom being mindful of the fact that the one that is speaking, is the one doing most of the learning. Therefore, in a One World classroom ambassadors are often engaged in discussions about the planned tasks, and activities in an effort to meet the day's objective where the teachers utilize a series of questions or prompt to cognitively challenge students thinking to either spark ambassador questions or to promote metacognition. 
 

 Ambassadors making connections and providing opportunities is an extremely critical component of the school. For example, the entire student body annually engages in Science Day where ambassadors take their learning to design experiments and projects. Additionally, all students participate in a school-wide dissection that is tiered by grade to investigate the systems, and scientific benefits to society and to ponder the ethical consequences. All ambassadors in the 8th grade take high-school level courses (Living Environment, US History, English 11, Algebra). As a result, 8th graders start their high school careers a grade ahead which allows them to have access to a college course for free or graduate a year early. Students at One World have the opportunity to visit colleges they have expressed interest in that are located locally and across state lines. Some of the colleges toured include Boston College, Harvard, Yale, SUNY Oneota, Howard, and many others. From touring colleges students who have graduated have enrolled in colleges such as Boston College and other SUNY programs. Through their expeditionary trips to monumental sites in history, like Selma, Gettysburg, and The Capitol ambassadors have been able to make connections to topics discussed in their classes.
 

 Other practices that are embedded at One World include a dedicated department and common planning time for teachers to meet, plan and revise units that are tailored specifically for the students they teach. Student-initiated clubs and student electives where ambassadors get an opportunity to express their interests and preferences for electives in a series of exit interviews."

Based on the core values of Relationships, Excellence, and Pride the faculty embraces creating the best learning environments possible for their students.  Three years ago, as the school began thinking more critically about equitable outcomes for all learners, they expanded and deepened opportunities for students to own their learning.  Flexibility with time resulted in RRHS allowing students to build individualized learning schedules depending on their interests and situation. All grade levels offer three distinct options - face to face instruction, distance learning, and flex-scheduling - to provide students agency when deciding on the environment that best meets their needs. Wednesdays provide intervention and enrichment services for students and personalized professional development for staff.
 
In anticipation of transitioning to a standards-based system for reporting on learning, the principal facilitated a voluntary book study on Grading for Equity, by Joe Feldman.  Avant-garde teachers now implement more equitable grading practices to their level of comfort and understanding.  This behavior has grown the network of interested teachers and expanded the grass roots of implementation in advance of a full transition in SY24.  

Administration also emphasizes student voice.  Beyond creative student scheduling, a student senate meets regularly to offer insight and guidance on decision-making, student artwork beautifies the campus in multiple areas, and a student cheering section actively drives school spirit!  Through the combination of voice and choice, the students REP in palpable ways.
 
With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, distance/flex scheduling, SOPs, and student voice remain the primary strategies advancing the school-wide mantra ""We REP!""

Vermont Agency of Education,583,White River Valley Middle School,"Bethel, VT",Vermont,White River Valley Supervisory Union,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country were forced to re-evaluate their priorities and restructure their operations to do their part in keeping students safe. For White River Valley Middle School, this meant shifting their classes from the traditional school building to a series of outdoor classrooms housed in tents across the campus and students sorted into “pods” with peers that shared similar schedules to minimize potential for cross-contamination. These were emergency measures, initially designed with only the immediate health and safety of students in mind. However, the opportunities to advance innovative educational strategies were not lost on school leadership. The shift to outdoor classrooms allowed for a flourishing of place-based curriculum, with students being encouraged to see the living world around them as a co-equal partner in their educational process. The reorganized pod structure created a new, small-group space where students could build relationships and adult mentors could give students more consistent attention.  
 

 We are moving into the endemic phase of COVID-19, and many of the emergency measures are beginning to subside. The tents that dotted the White River Valley Middle School campus are gone and students have returned to receiving instruction inside the school building, but that’s not to say things have returned to the way they were before. Students and teachers are still encouraged to look at learning with a place-based lens, students are still being taught to look at nature as a source for knowledge, and once a week students are still meeting with their pods to engage in restorative practices. In my eyes, this is the triumph of their leadership team. They were able to take the potential disruption of the pandemic and turn it into an opportunity to grow and strengthen."

Vermont Agency of Education,473,Winooski Middle High School,Winooski,Vermont,Winooski School District,"The Winooski Middle High School (WMHS) is strengthening and innovating upon existing programming to boost its STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) access to all students. The WMHS Computer-Based Music-Making Program launched in 2021, driven by student interest. The Computer-Based Music Making Program is a class offered to students that allows them to create, record, and produce their own music or audio recordings using computer technology. Approximately 45% of WMHS students have resettled in Winooski through the refugee resettlement program. Among them, they speak around 20 languages, predominantly Swahili, Somali, French, and Nepali. For these students, music is a common language. For some Winooski students, who struggle academically, music has been an anchor, keeping them connected to the district and providing an outlet for their talent. Many students want to make music in their own languages or write songs that students can sing in class. This program has enabled students to express themselves and connect with other students, and the broader community and is an excellent way to be inclusive and provide equitable access to arts education.
 

 Additionally, Winooski’s promise to their community includes: 
 Students have voice and choice in their learning.  
 • Students are excited about the topics they are learning as they are tied to their interests and their futures. 
 • Learning is personalized and is relevant and meaningful to each student. 
 • Each student develops a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs, interests and passions. 
 • Students own their learning, are confident, and are willing to take on leadership roles. 
  
 The Winooski High School environment encourages student DISCOVERY and RETENTION of learning. 
 • Each student’s individual learning needs are supported. 
 • Students choose how they learn and how they demonstrate their learning. 
 • Students advance at their own pace, with guidance from their advisor. 
 • Students move toward graduation as they master each topic. 
 • Classes are small in size and enable teachers to engage and challenge each student’s learning style and ability. 
  
 Winooski High School is preparing students for SUCCESS in the 21st century. 
 • Through our GXs and GPs, students learn new transferable skills like communication, critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration; essential skills that will help students work in ever-changing, diverse workplaces. 
 • Students study real-world topics through project-based learning which takes a topic a student is interested in and ties it with the skills the student needs to develop in particular areas, including math, science and English. 
 • Our schools’ diversity enables students to think globally, gain a deeper understanding of the world, and provides students with a unique leverage in achieving success in career and life. 
 • We focus on the whole student, mind, spirit and body and help students appreciate that wellness is something that they need and should carry on through life."
