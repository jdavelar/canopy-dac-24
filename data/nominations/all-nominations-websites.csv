"Anonymous",2019,3,"The Academy of Advanced Learning","","A tremendous bright spot with exceptional academic growth!  Vision: The vision of the AAL is founded on the notion that a Year 2025 workplace requires new skills and the ability to think critically. AAL prepares students for college and the modern workplace via personalized learning, allowing students to learn at a pace and modality that best fits his learning style and capitalizes on his strengths. AAL's instructional model integrates the following components: 1. LSAE Model. In this model, teachers deliver a lesson to all students for the first 20-30 minutes of class. They then sort students into four groups (Learning, Securing, Accelerating, Enriching) based on their demonstrated mastery of the skill. Depending on their needs, students receive small-group instruction or auxiliary lessons to extend or accelerate their learning, either via online learning or with a learning coach. 2. Student Learning Profiles and Plans. At the beginning of the school year, the school works with students and parents to develop a student learning profile, a document that includes students' past achievement data, strengths, areas for growth, and interests. Teachers are tasked with using the student learning profiles to develop student learning plans, customized strategies that are used to inform instruction of the student within the LSAE model. 3. Habits of Success and Learning How to Learn. The school has developed a set of """"Habits of Success"""" that they hope to instill in students, including """"be at school and on time,"""" """"strive for accuracy,"""" """"respect for others,"""" """"perseverance,"""" etc. The school is also using a self-assessment rubric once a week to help students learn how to learn, measuring learning skills such as """"I choose the right learning environment,"""" """"I am resourceful in finding assistance."""""

The school """"exceeds growth"""" under the state definition. An Opportunity Culture school extends the reach of excellent teachers and their teams to more students, for more pay, within the school's recurring budget. Multi-Classroom Leadership is the foundation of an Opportunity Culture; multi-classroom leaders (MCLs) lead a small teaching team, providing instructional guidance and frequent, on-the-job development, while continuing to teach part of the time. The schools redesign schedules to provide additional school-day time for teacher planning, coaching and collaboration. MCLs typically lead the introduction of more effective curricula, instructional methods, classroom management and schoolwide culture-building. Accountable for the results of all students in the team, multi-classroom leaders earn substantial pay supplements, within the regular school budget. The school design teams reallocate school budgets to fund pay supplements permanently, in contrast to temporarily grant-funded programs."

The Global Teaching Project is excited to nominate Booneville High School because of the tremendous efforts it is undertaking to provide historically underserved students access to AP courses. Notwithstanding Booneville's significant challenges, the blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.

Colleen Collins gave us an important lesson from her work there as principal: """"everyone needs to feel that they're part of the pilot."""" Meaning: initially the school worked deeply with its first cohort to co-develop the model, and then did the same with the second cohort; when it came time to bring the third cohort into the work, those teachers were told to watch the other cohorts and """"do what they do."""" That strategy produced some pushback from those teachers and convinced Colleen and other school leaders that in fact, it is crucial in designing and implementing agency-driven learning models to make sure that the adults are all experiencing the same kind of agency-driven culture. Later cohorts of teachers can't simply be asked to implement; they must be invited to co-create as much as earlier cohorts, even as they also are able to build on the work of those cohorts.

The school was designed by a team of teachers, who are the co-founders and current lead collaborators of the school. The objective was to create a school that serves a population that is representative of Greeley with demographics to match that of the community. The current student population is 50.8 % white and 49.1% Hispanic or multiple races, with 49% of the population receiving free or reduced lunch. Designed based on the belief that children are naturally curious and creative learners, the school's mission is to foster an atmosphere that encourages risk-taking and curiosity so that students are empowered to become problem-finders and problem-solvers. One of the hallmarks of FTSOI is the fidelity to its design foundations (mission, instructional vision, core values, and design priorities). The design foundations are not just a series of statements, but rather serve as the foundation for decisions and structures throughout the school and are evident in their daily practice. This leads to a school that iterates on the execution of this design, but still maintains a strong identity grounded in its founding principles. Students explore theme-based topics (loops), with cross-content connections that ask them to learn about topics and concepts in greater depth, in grade level bands. Ingrained in the heart of the school's culture is openness to failure and trying again. The goal is to make failure feel safe so that students aren't afraid to try new things. Additionally, teacher and leadership roles have been reimagined at this school. Teachers are known as Band Collaborators and generally teach two grade levels of students within their band.

The rubrics express clear expectations for each performance or project, which helps students self-assess their path forward for improving and/or progressing to the next unit. Students can work at their own pace without feeling left behind or waiting for the rest of the class. Students receive scores on a scale of 0 to 4. A 4 reflects exceeding mastery of the standard, a three reflects mastery, a 2 reflects a minor conceptual error, a 1 reflects a major conceptual error, and a 0 reflects no attempt at the standard or an attempt unrelated to the content.

But unlike most Montessori schools, this one has mapped high-expectation standards against and within Montessorian approaches and is supporting the work with various forms of enabling technology.

"Center for Teaching Quality (CTQ), Education Evolving",2019,168,"Reiche Community School","","Reiche Community School is the first teacher-powered school in Maine and serves a very diverse student population, many of whom qualify for free or reduced price lunch. They worked closely with their local association to transition to a teacher-powered model in order to better serve students.

Reiche is located near a large refugee processing and over 40% of their students are ESL, and of those over 40% are IELD. Reiche has over 40 languages spoken at their school and a high rate of poverty with 78% FRL.   Reiche was Maine's first """"failing"""" school. A progressive principal assigned to the school built leadership capacity and a highly collaborative culture among the staff. When the principal was reassigned, the Reiche teacher team worked with their union local to negotiate with their superintendent to assign an interim principal while they entered a year of exploration.   The team voted to convert to teacher-powered in 2011, something collaborative teams across the nation are beginning to explore. Today, the team selects three lead teachers on a rotating basis (each lead teacher serving four years) and every teacher participates in school-level decision-making.  With interest in opening the opportunity for other groups of teachers to replicate Reiche's model, the Maine legislature in 2013 passed, """"An Act to Develop a Grant Program to Establish a Teacher-led School Model."""" This Bill encourages teacher-powered schools by allowing schools or districts to apply for grant monies to explore, develop and implement alternative governance structures.  Under the teacher team's leadership, they have turned around their status as Maine's first failing school and are now a model for success. Reiche has found that if students stay at their school over 3 years (mobility is certainly an issue with their population) then proficiency rates start to dramatically rise.  The teacher team has decided to use a community school model to serve the many needs of their students and families. This means that they partner with local organizations to provide services to their students and families, for example, the Opportunity Alliance in Portland which provides children and adults with mental health services.

Staff and students who became sick while at school often could not be seen by a healthcare provider immediately, if at all. Beginning in 2018, Shawnee Public Schools partnered with the Team Clinics program to overcome these obstacles. With this partnership, Shawnee students and staff with health issues may go to the nurse's office and have a virtual doctor visit. In these virtual visits, the nurse connects online with a provider and, with special computer-connected equipment, the provider can check ears, noses, throats, lung sounds, and heartbeats. Often times, the patient receives a diagnosis and is treated within an hour or less. If the patient requires medication, the provider calls it into the pharmacy of the parent's choice.  Since the Team Clinic program began in September 2018, more than 110 students and staff have visited the virtual clinics. In that time, only one student and five teachers have been sent home due to illness.

"CT Center for School Change",2019,224,"West Woods Upper Elementary School","","West Woods Upper Elementary School is a grade 5-6 school with an enrollment of approximately 600 students. The school implements a student-centered approach aligned to Farmington's improvement design. Curriculum, instruction, programming, and assessment are aligned to purpose-driven, socially-constructed, mastery-based and self-directed learning. One specific example to share is FLEX time. FLEX time is a challenge and support block developed by WWUES teachers. FLEX time provides students with a menu of options to select from that are both teacher and student directed. Choice is a key element of the design and student-engaged assessment practices drive a self-directed model of challenge and support within this innovative model. Two years after this teacher-led innovation was developed, Farmington is implementing this design across K-8 schools. Clear standards and data driven decision-making are a key feature of WWUES' student-centered approach. All standards for the week are clearly articulated and the student work from the week provides the body of evidence that demonstrates student progress towards those standards. While many of the offerings are based on academic standards, they are not exclusively so. Sessions can focus on learner mindset, Vision of the Graduate skills, organization, or any other social/emotional or executive functioning skills that teachers identify as an area of need. Student self-reflection, voice and choice is key to this daily block. Students are given tools and feedback to assess their own strengths and needs and are trusted to make wise choices about how to most effectively make use of the time and support they are provided. Students who have met the standards are given the opportunity to exceed the standard by working on the standard at a more advanced level. WWUES implements a mastery-based approach to empower students as leaders of their own learning. Farmington's mastery-based principles are implemented in all classrooms. "
"Illinois State Board of Education",2019,225,"Wheeling High School","","Dr. Lazaro Lopez, then principal of Wheeling High School, met with manufacturers, business leaders and the local department of economic development in 2007 to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region needed to meet workforce demand. That partnership gave birth to the Township High School District 214 Career Pathways program. District 214 prepares its students for college and careers through experiential learning in 16 career clusters and 44 career pathways. The Career Pathways program currently serves more than 12,000 students from six comprehensive high schools, including Wheeling High School, and four specialized learning programs. District 214 purposefully eliminated the distinction between core courses and technical and career education courses. As many as 85 percent of District 214's students graduate having taken a college course, and two-thirds have completed nine semester hours of college credit by the time they graduate, an opportunity for considerable savings in tuition costs. Ninety-five percent of the district's students identify a career area of interest by graduation. Students have logged more than 2 million hours of workplace learning. The Educator Prep career pathway has served as a statewide model for addressing the teacher shortage. The teaching cluster begins with a sequence of high school courses that provide students an early feel for education as a career. Students who continue with the program earn early college credits and spend several days a week teaching lessons in actual K-12 classrooms under the close supervision of a master teacher. Students then can continue in the Educator Prep program with a postsecondary partner and earn a bachelor's degree and a teaching license. The district provides a network of supports for students while in college to increase the likelihood they graduate and become teachers. The district guarantees each student first access to interview for district teaching jobs. "

Project-based learning was an evolution of the school's model and they became an EL Education site in 2006. The day starts with a skill-based """"Brain Training"""" class followed by mixed-age Crew (akin to advisory). For the rest of the day, 10-12th graders work on one or two projects. Each project is 4-6 weeks in length. Freshmen have a more structured schedule, and educators work to help them acclimate to the project-based work to come. As a student approaches graduation, he or she will spend time off-campus in an internship or engaged in college classes. Students also design their own Capstone Projects. Projects integrate fieldwork, guest experts, and authentic audiences that help bring curriculum to life. The hands-on nature of the school's approach reflects a workplace environment that will prepare students for the future. As students develop products and presentations, they learn content while gaining academic and 21st-century skills like collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving. The school has a teacher residency program, which trains talent and serves as the main hiring pipeline.  "

Boston Day and Evening Academy will continue to be an innovative leader in student-centered education for off-track learners. Highlights: Competency Based Education-  The primary--and the crucial difference between a competency-based system of teaching and assessment and a traditional model, is that students begin a learning pathway (traditionally referred to as middle school or high school) based on assessed skill level in each content area, and not on arbitrary placement in grades (based on age). Each content area (i.e. Humanities, Math, Science, Technology) is divided into modules, which correspond to an academic semester, quarter, or trimester (see ROADMAP). After being assessed for their knowledge in each content area, students are placed into the module which puts them at their """"learning edge"""" i.e. challenging, but not overwhelming. Students progress from module to module in each content area, based on their ability to demonstrate mastery in each area, independently and multiple times. Once they meet the assigned benchmarks in each module, they become """"competent"""", and move on to the next module. If they finish a trimester without demonstrating competency in an area, they repeat that module--and that module only--while moving ahead in other content areas. Innovative Teaching Practices In addition to using competency-based teaching and assessment practices to drive the curriculum and inform the learning that takes place at BDEA, faculty are constantly embracing new forms of teaching that address the student-centered nature of their work. Blended Learning- We are thoughtful about how we are using technology to enhance learning, and hear from students that they need a balance of technology and personalized, teacher-led instruction.  Our approach has been to create a blended learning model that combines a variety of options including online courses, as well as technology-supported classes enhanced by the use of iPads, Smartboards and computers.  We have a Personalized Online Learning Lab (POLL) where students can catch up on classroom work or accelerate their progress through classes. But the bottom line is always having teachers available for support, direction, and conversation. Experiential Learning- For over a decade, BDEA has included Project Month as a way of turning all classes """"experiential"""", and giving students--and teachers--an opportunity to collaborate on projects that become an enduring part of the whole-school community.  One year, one of the projects turned an abandoned community clubhouse into a solar powered, hydroponic greenhouse. Another year, students engaged with the """"Occupy Boston"""" movement and recreated the experience of tent living, media coverage, and the genesis of the Arab Spring in a series of connecting classrooms at the school.   Active Learning- Active Learning takes many forms, from the expected inclusion of physical fitness into the everyday experience of our staff and students, to the authentic learning experience that results from theatrical movement classes taught by valued partners Actors' Shakespeare Project.   Our partners at Project Adventure helped us to understand and incorporate important aspects of """"active"""" learning into our teaching practice, coaching students to physically """"move through"""" diagrams  instead of writing them on a whiteboard, and to use space rather than fill it."

Dighton JSHS adopted a personalized learning approach that emphasized project-based learning at all grade levels and all subject areas.  The school adopted the Summit Learning Platform for grades 7 - 9 and then created a project-based learning academy for grades 10 - 12.  The PBL academy allowed any student in grades 10 - 12 to create projects aligned with the standards in the core content areas and present those projects to a community group to earn credit in any core content class.  Dighton JSHS also adopted a flexible schedule to allow students the opportunity to spend more time in classes they were passionate about.  The results speak for themselves; Dighton JSHS has a postsecondary effective rate more than 2 standard deviations above what KSDE would predict their rate to be, based on several factors (socioeconomic status, student mobility, chronic absenteeism rate).  I'm excited to nominate this school as they see themselves as the economic engine for the city of Dighton and the rest of Lane County.  Dighton is a very rural community with sparse population in western Kansas.  What they are doing to transform education in that small community is remarkable."
"Moonshot EdVentures",2021,266,"Embark Education","","Microschool embedded within two small businesses - a coffee shop and a bike shop; students get experience working in both"
"Education Reimagined",2021,266,"Embark Education","","Founded on the integration of community into every learning opportunity young people encounter, this learning environment is a one-of-a-kind model that takes advantage of both the learning spaces that already exist in the community and the opportunity to build out new ones that will give back to the community served.  Embark's primary learning spaces currently include a learning hub, a coffee shop, and a bike shopâ€”all of which exist solely for the purpose of serving Embark's young learners. This socially embedded, open-walled design naturally challenges young people to continuously push beyond their social and emotional comfort zones. Baked into every learning experience is the opportunity for the learner to reflect on their successes and failuresâ€”resulting in an ever-evolving understanding of their sense of self.  Developing a sense of self is a primary learning outcome at Embark. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized experiences, this outcome is achieved with remarkable consistency. Take one young learner who was learning at Embark's coffee shop, Pinwheel Coffee.  One day, she became particularly curious about the espresso machineâ€”its inner workings and what made espresso so appealing to the shop's customers. Questions began flying left and right in her mind: â€œHow does this espresso machine work? How profitable is a single espresso drink? What do we charge for an espresso? Why do we charge that much? Should we charge that much? Should we charge more or less? Where do our coffee beans come from? Who is our source?â€  Rather than having to let these questions go unanswered, Embark's learner-centered environment provides the space and opportunity for a rich and robust exploration to unfold. The young learner sat down with a mentor and reviewed the coffee shop's financialsâ€”developing an understanding of the cost and revenue of each espresso order. Then, she was able to contact the vendors who supplied the coffee beans to better understand how they were sourced. Shortly after her research concluded, the coffee shop did adjust their prices, citing her work as a contributing factor to the changes made.  So, through one unimpeded and wide-ranging learning experience, she was able to dig into business finance, business ethics, local and international trade, and supply chain management. Whereas a conventional setting might allow her to touch on a few of these topics in isolated, time-restricted units, this young learner dove right into the complexity and overlap of each topic within a real business settingâ€”guided by her own burgeoning learner agency.  Embark's focus on letting young learners lead the way requires adult leaders to be ready at a moment's notice to support the growth and development of new learning journeys no matter how unexpected they might be. And, it is the unexpected that keeps everyone passionately engaged in their work, ready to discover what each new day has to offer."

Museum staff regularly teach classes, and students partner with curators to help build exhibits that open up new learning for the community.  The GRPMHS curriculum is interdisciplinary and theme-based, with particular emphasis on global awareness, sustainability, and technology and design, explored through the lens of the history, culture, economy, and ecology of the Grand Rapids community and region. Students spend time working with community partners and collaborators all over the city (e.g., universities, nonprofits, scientists, artists, etc). Projects, including one designed to become the largest river-restoration project in the United States, take students into every aspect of the community and its surrounding environment. Lessons from community members complement instruction by formal educators, with community members proposing classes to teach as guest instructors. Examples from the existing middle school include everything from poetry writing and bicycle repair to a class focused on invasive species in the nearby Grand River.

They knew it to be true based on the scientific evidence they had gathered, and they set out to prove the findings. Through personalized, relevant, and contextualized learning, they have rewritten the story on what learners are capable of. There is no greater example than the young girl who proclaimed, â€œDandelions are the cure for cancer!â€  Rather than thinking, â€œthat's nice, honey,â€ her scientifically-minded mother and educators challenged her to prove it. And, off she went exploring scientific literature, utilizing her strengths as a writer, and creating a presentation for her community to assess her findings. Oh, by the way, this learner was five years old! And, she's one of many stories coming out of this socially embedded environment where every learner supports one another as they pursue their annual passion projects.  With an assessment framework that all but eliminates the ability to compare, learners aren't looking to compete with one another. They want to see everyone succeed and grow. Each learner is on a path to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that support their present and future yearnings, which are unimpeded by the individual interests of their peers.

Twenty times a year, young learners take part in overnight expeditions that, as exemplified by just one learner, can include state park backpacking trips, MAAP STARS Leadership retreats, YMCA Youth in Government experiences, an autism conference in Iowa, Women in Sciences expeditions to New Orleans, and more.  Expeditions out into the world are but one modality through which young people can make their learning personalized, relevant, and contextualized. When young learners aren't traveling, they are exploring their unique interests and passions on campus. Educators are trained to look for the â€œlittle gemsâ€ each of their learners leans intoâ€”like reading books or public speakingâ€”so they can integrate broader learning experiences through those modes of learning and expression.  While these interests and learning strategies are being discovered, learner agency is being built. NWPHS learners are expected to do far more than just obtain the credits and grades they need to graduate. Instead, they are given the space to learn who they are and how they can direct their own learning, which results in the creation of personalized learning plans. Each plan includes independent project ideas, seminars or workshops the young learner plans to attend, their expedition schedule, and personal goal statements. Overall, these plans show young people how they can take advantage of what's available to them here and now, rather than waiting for that next phase, be it college or career, where life supposedly begins.  A learner's self-confidence grows exponentially through NWPH's many supportive structures, including their focus on advisories. When a learner first steps foot inside NWPHS, they are welcomed by familiar faces each morning, creating a socially embedded culture that makes room for taking healthy risks and judgment-free failure. This culture allows learners to develop their personalized leadership styleâ€”enabling quiet leaders to lead through action and motivational leaders to make their contribution by handing out words of encouragement."

The core team's composition may vary from year to year depending on student and educator needs, interests and strengths. The educator team collaboratively designs curriculum and multidisciplinary projects, acting as guides who empower students as active learners and problem-solvers.

"Transcend",2021,366,"Van Ness Elementary School","https://www.vannesselementary.org/","We imagine a city â€“ and a nation â€“ where every child attends a school in which her or his well-being is a central priority. We imagine a nation where schools mitigate the negative effects of stress and trauma by establishing environments in which all students feel safe and loved and can develop the socio-emotional and academic skills they need to thrive.   Van Ness  Elementary School is building and testing a model that does just that.  Located in Ward 6 of the District of Columbia, Van Ness was closed in 2006 by DCPS due to under-enrollment but reopened after successful advocacy by neighborhood parents in 2015. Under the leadership of the founding Head of School, Cynthia Robinson-Rivers, Van Ness currently serves over 400 students  PK through 5th graders (ages 3-11 years old) and their families.  Van Ness serves a racially and socioeconomically diverse community of families in which approximately 51% of our students receive free or reduced lunch and 20% have special needs.   Over the past four years, Van Ness Elementary (a DC Public School) has focused on mitigating the negative effects of stress and trauma by creating learning environments in which all students feel safe and loved, and where they can develop the socio-emotional and academic skills they need to thrive. The result, the â€œStudent Well-being Model,â€ is rooted in the understanding that children's academic success is connected to their overall well-being. Rooted in the latest research in child development and learning, after four years of design, testing, and redesign, the Student Well-being Model has evolved into three unique but integrated sub-parts:    CARE (Compassion-Assertiveness-Relationships-Environment) creates a safe and predictable classroom community where students feel valued, learn to self-regulate, and work in ways that help them meet individual and class goals. It consists of whole-class rituals for the start of the day and for transitions, classroom structures, a set of teacher moves to foster relationships, and a safe and predictable classroom environment and design.   BOOST recognizes that approximately 5-10% of our students need a â€œboostâ€ in order to feel safe, build trusting relationships, and learn to self-regulate. Boost is a set of evidence-based interventions that classroom teachers can use directly, proactive group therapies, and individual interventions based on an analysis of the function of a child's behavior and history of trauma.   The final element of Student Well-being is to create a FAMILY CIRCLE composed of a student's school and home family. Grounded in the belief that close partnership with and active engagement from families is critical if we are to support a child's full development, school leaders and faculty conduct home visits with every student, communicate regularly with families through individual texts and class newsletters, partner with parents on academics, and hold parent events that foster community and teach strategies for how to support students at home.  In the school-year 2019-2020,  Van Ness spread the Student Well-being Model to 5 DCPS schools through the newly created Whole Child Collaborative (WCC).  This year, each school piloted the model in at least 2 classrooms and this fall each plan to roll-out the model to the full school. In addition, given the collective trauma created by COVID-19, this summer, Van Ness created easy-to-access implementation tools that allow schools to select and implement the model's SEL practices and mental health supports.  These resources will include a clear description of how each strategy connects to and supports the stressors and traumas students and families are currently facing as well as outline how each strategy"
"Anonymous",2021,368,"Verdi EcoSchool","","Centering the powerful relationship between young people and the community they live in is a key feature of Verdi EcoSchool, which offers a learner-centered environment to the Melbourne, Florida community. What they are today is a natural extension of their origin story as an intimate learning space created by a small number of local families who wanted their children to experience learning that leveraged community resources and prioritized the voices and choices of young people.  Verdi EcoSchool defines Melbourne's entire local arts district as their campus. With this open-walled take on a central learning hub, they are able to provide daily, immersive learning experiences that draw from and draw out learner' unique passions, interests, and curiosities. With young learners at the center of Verdi EcoSchool's design, powerful learning opportunities crop up in the most unexpected ways.  For example, while exploring their community, a group of young learners came to their advisor with a keen observation. The trail featured many plaques celebrating historical figures and their contributions to the area. But, they were all older, white men. The young learners, who did not see themselves or their culture in Melbourne's history, wanted to know what contributions people of color and women made toward the growth and development of the city.  In this moment, they were calling for a personalized, relevant, and contextualized experience and exercising their learner agency by owning their learning journey, rather than being passive participants.  This marked the beginning of a long-term project that, thanks to Verdi EcoSchool's competency-based framework, was seen as an entirely relevant learning opportunity. It fit perfectly inside their place- and nature-based learning philosophy.  Along the way, these young learners were fully immersed within a socially embedded context where peers, advisors, and community members were all seen as learning partners. The knowledge, skills, and dispositions these young learners cultivated during their preliminary research on Melbourne's history was just the tip of the iceberg for where they wanted to take things next. Once they discovered the story of Zora Neale Hurstonâ€”a prominent Black female literary figureâ€”they wanted to figure out how the community could honor her legacy."

When schedules are created, they focus on the student and not a school schedule like traditional programs. Every student's schedule is created based on their unique goals and plans. For example, one student may take all online courses while another student takes two online courses, one community partnership course, one college course, one project-based learning course, and has an internship. Students can choose from fully online courses, blended learning opportunities, dual enrollment, Early College or advanced course options, and other Gull Lake Community Schools building' offerings.   The flexibility offered by GLVP is attractive to K-12 full-time students, part-time students, home school students, and nonpublic/shared time students who want to discover their own individual talents. A range of virtual learning platforms are available to meet the needs of students. The school partners with community experts to offer optional learning experiences that allow virtual students to apply their learning. These elective virtual courses are designed in collaboration between a community expert and a GLVP teacher so that accurate content and effective online course design are both present. In addition to taking the online course, students have the option to attend an in-person session with the community expert. Unique course offerings include Reverse Engineering, Wilderness Survival and Adventuring, Confectionery Art, and Latin.   While many traditional schools say they are preparing their students for career and college, they try to fit the student into their programs. GLVP creates the program to fit the student. In their Early College program, students can choose from three different universities to receive an associates degree. Courses are offered both online and face-to-face with many supports from both GLVP and the colleges. In their senior year, students can choose to take a math for college success course that was created in partnership between the high school, GLVP, and a local community college."

Some courses use third-party vendor curriculum, but they also create custom courses for students or groups of students. The school has a drop-in learning space and offers courses with community partners.   OVA has a high level of academic rigor and requires 24 credits to graduate, but they offer many options for students to get there (i.e., multiple pathways to graduation). As Janet would describe, they are like the super highway to graduation because they offer the tools and capacity for students to choose their path and pace to graduation. Their student body is made up of students from different ethnic, socio-economic, and academic levels, yet each receives a personalized program to fit their needs. For example, traditionally homeschooled students may choose to enroll with OVA because they still have control over their learning with support from certified teachers. Students who want more rigor than the traditional school enroll to move ahead faster. The school has partnerships with foster care and court programs where they provide the path for those students to continue their education. One student may take courses from three different vendors while another is taking two online courses, two college courses, an art course at a local community partner, and getting credit for a job through a work-based program.   I am always amazed at the perseverance and commitment they have for each individual student. Whether a student is in kindergarten or 10th grade, they don't have to fit into the school's box for learning. They can create their own path with the support from OVA's administrators, counselors, teachers, and mentors."

This effort allowed students, parents, educators, and community members in the newly formed Windsor Central Modified Unified Union District to collectively construct a vision of their graduates and a plan for enabling learners to meet those expectations. The strategic plan that was developed provides a clear roadmap with the Portrait of a Graduate being their â€œnorth star.â€ Leadership recognized the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in a meaningful process to achieve positive change. I was fortunate to be able to attend sessions and observe the high-level of commitment by all involved.   A systems perspective is also evident in Windsor Central's strategic plan through intentional connections between strategies and the Portrait of a Graduate competencies. For instance, Strategy 1.2 states, â€œAchieve a high level of math proficiency for all students through curriculum review, classroom instructional practices, professional development, and robust interventions so that all students reach their full potential.â€ The related Portrait Competency, Academic Excellence, is identified in order to ensure coherence between strategies and competencies.   At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects. This â€œTeacher's Toolkitâ€ is aimed at providing strategies for fostering skills and dispositions within the PoG. It was developed by educators as a resource to bring the PoG to life in classrooms. The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  â—	Create a culture of â€œDeep Learningâ€ in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; â—	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; â—	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; â—	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; â—	Develop a list of â€œinstructional lensesâ€;  â—	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  â—	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpack' tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them.

"Anonymous",2021,101,"Impact | Puget Sound Elementary","","Impact | Puget Sound Elementary (PSE) is the flagship campus for Impact Public Schools, the first homegrown Washington state elementary charter network. After opening in 2018, Impact | PSE has proven that its model has the ability to narrow, and eventually close, the opportunity gap for historically marginalized students in south Puget Sound. Impact | PSE uses a model rooted in three design principles:  [1] Relationships: Fostering secure attachments within a tight-knit community of learners using a small group mentor model. [2] Agency: Working with families and students to develop comprehensive, personalized learning pathways for each individual scholar [3] Liberation: Creating deep, authentic learning experiences for students that lead to activism through the exploration of contextualized topics that are relevant in student' communities.  The Impact | PSE model employs an expanded definition of student success. While Core Skills are critical to student success, Impact | PSE also believes that deeper learning skills and social-emotional skills are essential to support the next generation of equity-driven, innovative leaders. These three design principles are the foundation for achieving this vision of student success.   Impact | PSE's implementation of a decolonized project-based learning (PBL) program is a stand-out element of the school model. The PBL curriculum has been designed to shift the dominant perspective and highlight voices, stories, and information that has not been emphasized in how students traditionally learn history. These projects lift up the indigenous perspective and work to break down institutional racism many educational systems continue to perpetuate. Impact | PSE operates with the belief that all scholars deserve to see themselves and their experiences reflected in what is being taught in their classrooms. All students deserve to learn about and be exposed to writers, artists, historians, community heroes and leaders who share their background and identity. In order for the Impact | PSE curriculum to be liberating, it must be rooted in the local communities it serves. At Impact | PSE, instructional leaders ensure that the liberated PBL model is replicable by developing a rigorous and relevant base curriculum that includes assessment tools, lesson plans and exemplars. Then, the school provides systems, structures (including a process for community/parent design input) and professional development to ensure the projects are rooted in the school community. This two-part method ensures that the curriculum is not rooted in the command, control and regurgitation of facts, but instead in the exploration of important, relevant questions that allow students to create real products and showcase them in front of a live audience of peers, parents and community members."

"Vermont Agency of Education",2021,389,"Central Vermont Career Center","","As a local control state, when Vermont transitioned to proficiency based graduation requirements, each school district was left to develop its own specific requirements, informed by resources provided by the Agency of Education. Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion."

Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: â€¢	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. â€¢	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. â€¢	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: â€¢	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. â€¢	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. â€¢	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: â€¢	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. â€¢	Begin Equity student focus groups. â€¢	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. â€¢	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. â€¢	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. â€¢	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL's 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.  MVU is in its 4th year of working with Think: Kids and using the Collaborative Problem-Solving approach with students.  Three staff are training to become certified Think: Kids trainers in order to grow the capacity to use Collaborative Problem Solving schoolwide."
"Vermont Agency of Education",2021,394,"Hazen Union High School","","Hazen Union High School continues to expand their course offerings and programs to ensure that all students are empowered with the knowledge and skills needed to achieve their full potential and become successful, responsible, and contributing members of society, both locally and globally. Hazen is committed to heterogenous grouping allowing students to choose an academic path best suited to their learning goals where each student selects a program reflecting their individual interests, abilities, and needs.  Hazen Union recently piloted a student-centered driven, student-designed, advanced manufacturing course and makerspace using student personalized learning plans (PLPs) as a tool for students to co-design and co-develop curriculum with teachers and community partners. This pilot expanded upon Hazen's well-established Work-Based Learning (WBL) Program and Independent Based Learning (IBL) Program. In response to COVID-19, Hazen Union and community partners leveraged the grant funded equipment to print face shields for Vermont doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The community partners worked with the students virtually throughout the process, providing opportunities to engage in design-thinking methods and skill attainment that could be applied across contexts. Upon completion of the pilot, the student cohort presented their curriculum, reflections, and deliverables to OSSU School Board members with recommendations to support the sustainability of this program. Students were empowered to demonstrate their competency in communication, advocacy, and action research in order to maintain this student-centered program for their peers. The success of this program conveys the importance of education and community partnerships and the positive impact student voice has within the school system and the community at large. This year, the program has tripled in size with the support of community partnerships. This unique learning model allows students to develop competency across content areas, technical skills, and transferable skills. Even throughout the pandemic Hazen Union continues to provide students the agency to personalize their learning inclusive of the instructional dispositions and learning models available within their WBL and IBL Programs."
"MiCoOp",2021,478,"West Michigan Virtual Academy","","Not many virtual schools offer a drop-in center for middle school students. West Michigan Virtual Academy (WMVA) serves middle and high school students, grades 6-12. When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around student' social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.  Their drop-in center is located at the city's recreation center so WMVA has the ability to offer their virtual lifetime fitness classes with an in-person component. They also offer optional career field trips and guest speakers for all 300 students. Before COVID, the drop-in lab would regularly see 30-40 students who came in for assistance, many of them showing up multiple times a week. WMVA also has partnerships with the local career tech center and three local colleges where students can earn career skills and/or college credits."
"MiCoOp",2021,475,"Link Learning","","There are many reasons I am excited to nominate Link Learning, but the main reasons are their partnerships with schools around the state and how they use their data to improve student learning. Link Learning partners with brick and mortar schools that have exhausted their options for students who need a personalized learning plan and individual support. While most of these students are at-risk, Link Learning also serves the non-traditional learner like homeschoolers, professional high school athletes, students with unique medical conditions, youth in the justice system, and early parents. Students take just one or two courses at a time. Even though Link Learning is a virtual school, they have learning centers around the state for students to come and learn in a welcoming, supportive environment. Their partnership with the brick and mortar schools also allow their students to take seated courses.   Link Learning uses a tool to manage student engagement and progress. The program was developed in partnership with a software development company and their district, including virtual teachers. It automatically collects data from their LMS and records their staff interactions to get a whole-child view of each student. Within this system, they have the ability to see where a student falls in MTSS so they can intervene more quickly. The data is reviewed daily by teachers, weekly by learning center directors, and monthly by the quality assurance team (who support staff professional learning). Their data shows that the more intentional the teacher-student conversations, the more students are engaged, and the greater their academic achievement. These intentional conversations focus on helping students understand their role in learning, making a plan to fit education into their lives, and reflecting on their progress.   There is also a heavy focus on social-emotional learning. The school has staff specifically assigned to EL students, 13 special education staff, and social workers who work with students and staff. Relationships are built between students, staff, and parents to develop a community where they all feel they belong. Professional learning for staff includes shifting mindsets. First, they must understand that getting at-risk students to enroll is a success in itself. Once enrolled, they need to create connections and relationships so they are taught how to talk and relate to students. After relationships are built and students start engaging, they can focus conversations on learning such as time on task, number of days in class, and what they did when they were successful. The staff also works with students to help them self-regulate with the goal for them to become effective members of society."

"Anonymous",2021,391,"Bellows Free Academy","","Franklin West Supervisory Union (FWSU) has identified four target areas for continuous school improvement and student growth: student-centered, proficiency-based, personalized learning; flexible learning environments; student leadership; and engaged community partners. Along with all other schools in Vermont in compliance with Act 77, FWSU is also moving forward with a proficiency-based curriculum model that emphasizes essential academic concepts, content, and skills, including Transferable Skills, to help ensure our students are college and career-ready.â€¯ â€¯   The connections among the national standards, local curriculum, and classroom instruction and assessment play a critical role in an integrated design of engaging and relevant learning opportunities for students. Educators believe an integrated approach is the â€œbest fit'' for meeting targets. Project-based learning (PjBL) is one strategy used for integrating content. Although there are currently PjBL â€œislands of excellenceâ€ in science and world language, implementing this approach holds the potential for growth in the future.   Proficiency-driven opportunities highlight learning thatâ€¯isâ€¯personalized and learning environments that are flexible. FWSU's goal is to ensure that their students receive a â€œfuture-ready, world-class educationâ€ and graduate with the knowledge and skills to successfully pursue their goals.    Bellows Free Academy (BFA), the supervisory union high school, has been leading this work and providing guidance for the elementary schools. Outcome proficiencies cut across all four years of high schools with performance indicators being used to determine proficiency. Educators are refining common assessments and provide different pathways for students to achieve expected outcomes. The principal of BFA is a master at developing a schedule with blocks of varying amounts of time to create a learning environment that is responsive to the needs of learners. There is a comprehensive approach to supporting students. Educators know their students deeply and create a culture that is connected and authentic.   Performance assessments in grades eight and ten prepare students for a capstone project in twelfth grade. There are also pathways to distinction that are available which are personalized according to a student's interest. This opportunity â€œignites a fireâ€ for some students.  BFA administrators and staff have been engaged in learning and having conversations about equity for several years. Last spring, while on dismissal, racial justice became a  part of their student's world. School had ended for the summer, but leadership knew they couldn't wait for the fall to connect with students about this important issue. A group of teachers decided to put out an open invitation to have a discussion about what was going on in the world and how to move forward together. Around a dozen students joined the first zoom session. They asked questions about the return to school and other topics before the conversation shifted to equity and racial justice in their school. At first, the teachers facilitated the conversation, but somewhere in the middle of the summer, the students took over the agenda and the conversation. Their goal was to provide opportunities for the student body to join the conversation about racial justice in their school and in the world, and ultimately improve the culture of BFA. Thus, the Fairfax Racial Justice  Alliance (RJA) began. Since the start of the school year, students have been exposed to the four agreements and the compass from Courageous Conversations. They have had discussions about equity using case studies that explore socio-economic, cultural and racial bias, and equity. Work in advisory complements the goals of the BFA Fairfax  RJA.   Additionally, an early warning system approach is in place to examine if certain students are being marginalized. Educators recognize the importance of confronting evidence about which students are historically privileged, and which are not. This process is strengthening practices to support all learners. Both the student and the system levels are being analyzed to determine where inequities exist and how to implement change.

While technology is used in the classroom as a resource and for supplementary activities, students spend most of their time physically with their teachers.

The school’s mission states: “Challenging students to think and learn for themselves.” The staff has implemented learner-centered practices and systems to make this mission a reality. The academic program provides multiple learning pathways that enable every learner to be college, career, and community ready on a personal path.  Learners track their data and regularly set goals during time designated across the campus.

Agency is a natural outcome of the options at San Luis. Besides the conventional structures such as Student Council and National Honor Society, student voice is intentionally amplified through the principal’s Student Advisory group, where students are leading a positive campus culture.

Key in the shift is a focus on mastery learning and an expectation of student success – no matter what it takes. Three years ago, a small group of teachers and the principal began studying and applying standards-based grading principles. Today, over 60 percent of the staff participate. The shift has evolved into equitable systems of grading and assessment across the campus, resulting in student agency and ownership of the learning. Students know the vision is for them to attain the highest level of proficiency/mastery. If they don’t succeed on the first attempt, they’ll have choice and opportunity to reassess. The staff believes that all students can succeed, and they insist on rigor by not allowing them to fail. Students own their learning and share their data with parents in regular emails. Collaboration, project-based learning, and flexible seating environment enable learners to flourish academically. 

Developing leadership and ensuring voice are critical at Cibola. The Courtesy Corps of student leaders in each classroom greet visitors and explain the focus of the day’s learning. Administration ensures student voice shapes the school culture. For example, a student focus group will roll out the new Portrait of a Graduate to the student body and provide ideas on systems to embed the POG in Cibola daily life. Adult agency has grown from teachers learning from teachers (TLFT). Teachers lead professional learning opportunities, participate in peer-to-peer classroom observations and feedback loops, and choose their personal learning pathways to grow their practice. Leaders provide time and support for the adult learning; as a result, teachers completed 82 digital PCBL learning modules in November. The Culture and Climate at Cibola High School has purposefully shifted. Staff believes that all students can succeed, and the focus is on developing the “whole student”, with student growth being the priority.

Three years ago, as the school began thinking more critically about equitable outcomes for all learners, they expanded and deepened opportunities for students to own their learning.  Flexibility with time resulted in RRHS allowing students to build individualized learning schedules depending on their interests and situation. All grade levels offer three distinct options - face to face instruction, distance learning, and flex-scheduling - to provide students agency when deciding on the environment that best meets their needs. Wednesdays provide intervention and enrichment services for students and personalized professional development for staff.
 
In anticipation of transitioning to a standards-based system for reporting on learning, the principal facilitated a voluntary book study on Grading for Equity, by Joe Feldman.  Avant-garde teachers now implement more equitable grading practices to their level of comfort and understanding.  This behavior has grown the network of interested teachers and expanded the grass roots of implementation in advance of a full transition in SY24.  

Administration also emphasizes student voice.

Concerned about learning loss when virtual school was the only option, teachers engaged in professional collaboration to address those learning gaps. Prioritizing standards in ELA and Mathematics was a first step in the construction of an equitable viable Learning Continuum, where progressions of learning and readiness assessments were developed for the standards. As teachers continued to collaborate in both grade level and vertical teams, it was clear the curriculum work they had done served a larger purpose than addressing learning gaps – it had in fact provided an opportunity to foster agency in all learners!

"Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship",2023,660,"One World Middle School","http://www.owms529.org","As a school community, One World Middle School has reimagined the learning of what education looks like in how students experience school as a whole. At the foundational core, they believe that students have the right to a quality and innovative standards-based education, the right to know and be known in a safe and welcoming environment, and the right to be acknowledged as unique individuals who learn differently. These core beliefs promote and advance equity and student-centered learning throughout the school. It is evident upon walking through the halls, the classrooms, and interacting with the students that their core beliefs live and breathe through how they view the purpose of education and the instructional core, and the structures they deem important.
 

 One World Middle School has proven that in order to have a reimagined equitable learning environment, two components must be in place: a safe learning environment and a staff that knows who the children are and their individual needs. To support this idea they have implemented practices and events such as Ambassador Day, Unit 0, and Developing the Whole Child Meeting (DWC). Ambassador Day is quite the experience as students across all grades are given the opportunity to select their mentors for the year. During this particular day, students engage in community-building activities by spending the entire day in small groups with their teacher mentor discussing their commonalities and differences and learning to embrace each other diversity and strengths. Throughout the year the mentors meet weekly to plan and conduct themed-based activities. For example, in November and December, mentor groups coordinate events and activities around gratitude and acts of kindness respectively. These student-led initiatives have taken different forms over the years from groups creating donation drives, reading to students at neighborhood elementary schools, making edible treats that are distributed to fellow peers, volunteering at Senior Health Centers to simply redesigning a classroom space. 
 

 In thinking about how to continually engage students and to make sure all learners see themselves in the curriculum, One World Middle School acknowledges and celebrates the various cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity that comprises the school community through their first unit of the year. One World Middle School in all grades and content areas uses the first unit of the year which is called Unit 0 to focus on student identity and understanding the child. In addition, there are weekly meetings programmed called Developing the Whole Child (DWC) where teacher teams create action plans for ambassadors who may need support academically, socially, or emotionally. These strategies are often grounded in the Pre-referral Intervention Manual (PRIM) or Adaptation for Adolescents with Autism and Asperger's manual (A-5) to tailor the support to effectively meet the needs of the student. The teams continually discuss the outcomes of the strategy with each other as well including the student for their input. Teams reflect on progress as they monitor the impact on student learning.  
 

 At One World it is evident that they are thoughtful about the language they use with their students and in their space. It is a common belief that the process for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that equitably supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults begins with language which is clearly intertwined in the fabric of the school. The school truly believes that the words students encounter on daily basis, they will in turn embody. Thus, students are addressed as ambassadors because they are encouraged and provided with opportunities to be agents of change. The word ambassador coincides with the school's construction as they operate under a United Nations model where ambassador voices are influential in the way the school functions and the changes that occur. An example of a system in place is the school's embassy delegates which include members from all grades that meet biweekly with the principal. These meetings range from discussing issues and making suggestions, to planning events such as LGBTQ Coming Out Day, Autism Awareness Day, or Breast Cancer Awareness Day which is driven by the consensus of the student body. These student-centered planned events foster a level of self and others. Every morning during morning assembly the school gathers together to proclaim as one voice, """"I want today to be one of the greatest days of my life"""" to establish a positive feeling and tone for the day. As a mantra, to work and live by, the school leadership believes and promotes that each year they must create a learning environment and community that is more impactful than the previous year. 
 

 It is without a doubt, that the ambassador's academic outcome is at the core of One World Middle School's instructional focuses and practices. They have demonstrated that ambassadors learn best when they have an opportunity to collaborate with peers and then make their thinking visible. Practices in place to support that students constantly engage with other students start with the structure of how the room is designed. At One World all classes are designed to accommodate a variety of grouping configurations. These configurations support opportunities over the course of a lesson for ambassadors to engage in turn and share and work on group assignments as well as projects in a seamless manner. Teachers have collaborated on phased protocols to promote partner discussions. As a best practice, all classrooms are equipped with two certified teachers to ensure that on a daily basis all needs of their children are met. Teachers take a less active role in talking in the classroom being mindful of the fact that the one that is speaking, is the one doing most of the learning. Therefore, in a One World classroom ambassadors are often engaged in discussions about the planned tasks, and activities in an effort to meet the day's objective where the teachers utilize a series of questions or prompt to cognitively challenge students thinking to either spark ambassador questions or to promote metacognition. 
 

 Ambassadors making connections and providing opportunities is an extremely critical component of the school. For example, the entire student body annually engages in Science Day where ambassadors take their learning to design experiments and projects. Additionally, all students participate in a school-wide dissection that is tiered by grade to investigate the systems, and scientific benefits to society and to ponder the ethical consequences. All ambassadors in the 8th grade take high-school level courses (Living Environment, US History, English 11, Algebra). As a result, 8th graders start their high school careers a grade ahead which allows them to have access to a college course for free or graduate a year early. Students at One World have the opportunity to visit colleges they have expressed interest in that are located locally and across state lines. Some of the colleges toured include Boston College, Harvard, Yale, SUNY Oneota, Howard, and many others. From touring colleges students who have graduated have enrolled in colleges such as Boston College and other SUNY programs. Through their expeditionary trips to monumental sites in history, like Selma, Gettysburg, and The Capitol ambassadors have been able to make connections to topics discussed in their classes.
 

 Other practices that are embedded at One World include a dedicated department and common planning time for teachers to meet, plan and revise units that are tailored specifically for the students they teach. Student-initiated clubs and student electives where ambassadors get an opportunity to express their interests and preferences for electives in a series of exit interviews."

The WMHS Computer-Based Music-Making Program launched in 2021, driven by student interest. The Computer-Based Music Making Program is a class offered to students that allows them to create, record, and produce their own music or audio recordings using computer technology. Approximately 45% of WMHS students have resettled in Winooski through the refugee resettlement program. Among them, they speak around 20 languages, predominantly Swahili, Somali, French, and Nepali. For these students, music is a common language. For some Winooski students, who struggle academically, music has been an anchor, keeping them connected to the district and providing an outlet for their talent. Many students want to make music in their own languages or write songs that students can sing in class. This program has enabled students to express themselves and connect with other students, and the broader community and is an excellent way to be inclusive and provide equitable access to arts education.
 

 Additionally, Winooski’s promise to their community includes: 
 Students have voice and choice in their learning.  
 • Students are excited about the topics they are learning as they are tied to their interests and their futures. 
 • Learning is personalized and is relevant and meaningful to each student. 
 • Each student develops a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs, interests and passions. 
 • Students own their learning, are confident, and are willing to take on leadership roles. 
  
 The Winooski High School environment encourages student DISCOVERY and RETENTION of learning. 
 • Each student’s individual learning needs are supported. 
 • Students choose how they learn and how they demonstrate their learning. 
 • Students advance at their own pace, with guidance from their advisor. 
 • Students move toward graduation as they master each topic. 
 • Classes are small in size and enable teachers to engage and challenge each student’s learning style and ability. 
  
 Winooski High School is preparing students for SUCCESS in the 21st century. 
 • Through our GXs and GPs, students learn new transferable skills like communication, critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration; essential skills that will help students work in ever-changing, diverse workplaces. 
 • Students study real-world topics through project-based learning which takes a topic a student is interested in and ties it with the skills the student needs to develop in particular areas, including math, science and English. 
 • Our schools’ diversity enables students to think globally, gain a deeper understanding of the world, and provides students with a unique leverage in achieving success in career and life.

"Bluum",2024,811,"Alturas International Academy","https://www.alturasacademy.org/","Alturas International Academy is an innovative change for education. With a master approach to education, their students are taught in small group instruction at instructional levels. This gives students the opportunity to work with partners and collaborate at high levels using analytical and critical thinking skills. Alturas Prep will expand on an already established program that teaches self-discipline and responsibility to all students; provides a physical environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning; promotes communication and interaction in the classroom; supports an effective environment that promotes a sense of belonging and self esteem; and provides an academic environment that promotes learning and self-fulfillment.

The Alturas International Academy uses the Primary Years Program (PYP) designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) as a curriculum framework for young learners. Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to react, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment. Like all IB programs, PYP is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas. In the process, students develop critical thinking, research, self-management, communication, and social skills.

At Alturas, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six trans-disciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry are:

Who we are
Where we are in place and time
How we express ourselves
How the world works
How we organize ourselves
Sharing the planet

Units of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, information technology, science, and social studies, helping students make meaningful connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.

INQUIRY-BASED:
The Primary Years Program (PYP) is based on a commitment to inquiry-based teaching and the development of the whole child; socially, emotionally, and intellectually. A core belief is that children learn more effectively when they are actively involved in the learning process and build upon existing knowledge in real-life contexts – In other words, when learning is relevant and engaging.

MULTILINGUAL: 
Spanish is the language of instruction in our K–5 elementary school program.  We welcome students from all language backgrounds. Over 80% of our students begin with no Spanish language at home.

NURTURING ENVIRONMENT: 
Alturas' smaller class sizes ensure that the teachers and staff can focus on students’ social and emotional development in addition to their intellectual progress. From a place of safety, students are encouraged to inquire, wonder, and investigate—to lay the foundations of interculturally sensitive and inquisitive lives.

EXPERIENCED, CARING TEACHERS: 
Alturas' teachers provide opportunities for students to build meaning and refine understanding through structured inquiry. Outside the classroom, Alturas teachers are an integral part of our community.

REAL-WORLD CONNECTIONS: 
Students synthesize and showcase their learning by applying new knowledge to real-world problems and working collaboratively to find solutions.  For example, 5th-grade students work in groups to prepare an exhibition and presentation about a topic of their choice, showcasing their self-guided learning to the community.

What stands out about this school's model is that students don't just make a few arbitrary choices, but exercise real agency in all of the meaningful aspects of their learning from start to finish.  Teachers have truly shifted their roles from telling students what to learn and how to learn it, to helping students drive their own learning.  Finally, the school has made rapid progress in implementing their model by setting consistent expectations for all teachers and providing school-wide professional development.

Over the past three years, Central has implemented a school-wide blended learning approach to their teaching and learning. Focusing on a station rotation model in grades K-3 and mixture of a flex/station model in grades 4-5.  There are three components that drive the work at Central;  data-driven instruction, differentiation, and school culture,   Data-driven Instruction: Every teacher has been trained in and uses formative assessment to develop their lessons.  Teachers use a family of measures to guide their instructions: such-as exit tickets, anecdotal evidence, and student work samples.   Differentiation:  Teachers use a flexible grouping process determined by student classroom data to differentiate the learning environment for their students.  Station rotations allow students to personalize their learning and have a choice in the pace of their learning.  These stations are teacher-led, student-led, and include independent learning opportunities, affording students multiple pathways for success.  They meet as a whole group for broad concept instruction, in small group with the teacher or 1:1 with support personnel for more intensive instruction, and work independently applying their learning.  School Culture: The culture of Central Elementary is purposefully designed and developed by a team of teachers, the school psychologist, and the principal.  A Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) team meets monthly to monitor and guide the school culture of respect, responsibility, and safety to self and others.

These chairs are the proud handiwork of Manual Academy students and one example of the school project- and competency-based approach to education. Peoria School District 150 is part of Illinois' competency-based education pilot program. Manual Academy teachers and leaders have found that competency-based education allows students to take greater advantage of partnerships and opportunities with local businesses.       Global manufacturing giant Caterpillar is headquartered in Peoria and is one of the region's largest employers. Formerly a technical high school, Manual Academy partners with Caterpillar to prepare students for careers in manufacturing technologies. Caterpillar provides donated supplies, volunteer mentorships, a welding camp, and a $300,000 grant to support a full manufacturing curriculum co-taught at Manual Academy and Peoria's Caterpillar plant. Competency-based education also paved the way for innovative programs like Fuse Studio, a hands-on engineering lab where students choose their own projects.      Students in the Caterpillar Hiring Innovation Program learn academic concepts through hands-on experiences from painting to assembly and the most popular applied skill, welding. Students learning welding are positioned to have the skills to achieve American Welding Society certification before graduation. Engineering and industrial technology teachers spend one day a week with students and mentors at Caterpillar to supervise and track student learning goals. They track student communication and collaboration alongside trade skill milestones. The curriculum concludes with a direct pathway to real manufacturing jobs with Caterpillar upon completion.

For content learning, students decide when they're ready to take assessments, receive immediate feedback, and can review materials or practice to incorporate the feedback, and then re-assess when they're ready.  During project time too, teachers check in with students to give feedback as needed. Learner autonomy and agency are a priority in Summit schools.

Typically in elementary schools, this task is left to students in the upper grades to run. Not at Galileo. The second graders are the ones who run the monthly store which includes, but is not limited to, budgeting, handling all transactions, calculating net and gross profit, advertising, and evaluating business plans from other students. The level of autonomy afforded the students is remarkable and keeps them highly engaged as active learners. This leads to the second trait. The students are almost continually engaged in cross-discipline, project-based learning. At Galileo, everything starts with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and then subjects are integrated into the project along with the corresponding standards. They routinely utilize the engineering design process as they seek to solve real world problems, primarily of their own choosing.

By that I mean it doesn't offer busing or provide student lunches, there are no extracurricular activities - sports or otherwise - so students don't leave school early to attend away contests, and there are no assemblies to disrupt the regular school day. While at first glance this might seem to be somewhat grim, the concept appears to be quite successful as is evidenced by the fact that enrollment/demand continues to increase, students are exceedingly well prepared for college and career, staff turnover is minimal, and both parents and community partners are enthusiastic supporters of the school and its emphasis on STEM education.   With a very business-like orientation, students come to """"work"""" from 8:00 to 4:00, Monday through Thursday and they all wear school-approved uniforms, are expected to have a strong work ethic, self discipline and are held accountable for the choices they make. Teachers do not accept late work from students at any grade level or in any subject area. Mornings are spent in traditional academic subjects, while every afternoon students are engaged in a variety of projects, both individually and in groups, to apply their learning. This model has allowed students at NISCA to excel in STEM to an unprecedented level for a small, rural school. Accomplishments include working with NASA to successfully launch a nano satellite and a trip to Washington DC to present to NASA engineers, senators and congressmen. The school also routinely performs well in FIST LEGO League, FIRST Tech Challenge, Mars Rover and MATHCOUNTS, among other state and national competitions.

"Big Picture Learning",2021,326,NA,NA,"At Odyssey, young people are embedded in a flexible learning environment where community, curiosity, and creativity are unrestricted. They can imagine, design, and pursue learning pathways that are unique to their individual passions and engage in deeply personal learning experiences every day. Young learners (and their families) own the learning process.  From day one, families are enrolled through an intentional onboarding program. Family members explore and communicate their hopes and dreams for their kids, and the role they hope to play in seeing those dreams fulfilled. Young learners build a flexible learner profile that reveals their interests, aspirations, and challenges. With input from the whole family, a blueprint is created for connecting young learners with personalized, relevant, and contextualized opportunities.  In practice, this blueprint might land a young learner out in the community at a local food bank where socially embedded learning through conversations with staff, volunteers, and patrons is abundant. Within this open-walled experience, the young learner is deeply engaged in social, nutritional, and philanthropic studiesâ€”where the high-level, competency-based outcomes they develop carry over to whatever sparks the young learner's curiosity next.  Starting with general interests and passions rather than specific careers (or content standards) allows Odyssey learners (and their advisors) to gain exposure to once unknown possibilities. As they build their knowledge, skills, and dispositions within this learner-centered framework, they continuously develop a strong sense of learner agencyâ€”embracing their innate independence and leadership to explore what the world has to offer and how they can contribute to their community.  Learning at Odyssey meets every young learner where they are, which organically leads to a one-of-a-kind â€œrecipeâ€ of learning that is dynamic and palatable. All of this has been possible since their first year of operation, thanks to the unique combination of ingredients Odyssey leaders know makes for authentic and rich learning.

As a result of this work, River Bend Career and Technical Center determined that they needed to have zero tolerance for displays of the Confederate flag (e.g. on student clothing, backpacks, notebooks, vehicles, etc.). Brian Emerson, the school's Director (Principal), reports that it was hard work, but they stayed the course. He notes that the work River Bend Career and Technical Center has done over the past five years has positioned them to continue to address issues of equity and inclusion and to work toward racial equity in a very rural community with limited racial diversity."

"Vermont Agency of Education",2021,393,NA,NA,"Randolph Union Middle/High School is designing for equity through the implementation of ongoing equity-focused professional development in the form of Professional Learning Communities. Faculty meet regularly in small groups to discuss current equity issues in the school and wider community, explore solutions, examine implicit bias, and to research and develop different curricular and pedagogical resources. These PLC groups provide a means through which to foster a culture of continuous equity learning amongst faculty, as well as a space to process personal experiences with inequity and bias. As part of RU's regularly scheduled professional development, the PLC structure is supporting faculty in developing equity as a lens through which to approach teaching and learning.  As part of this ongoing professional development, RU developed a set of social justice standards adapted from those published by Teaching Tolerance, called the Democratic Engagement Standards. These standards provide a structure through which teachers can design learning experiences that ask students to grapple with issues related to identity, equity, and structural injustice. RU is currently in the pilot year of using these standards, working towards identifying places in the curriculum that already provide opportunities to address these topics, in addition to places where these standards and topics could be further developed. As the Democratic Engagement Standards are not content-area specific, and can be integrated into any subject area, RU is actively working towards incorporating this essential work in classes beyond just the humanities.  The equity-focused PLC program also works to foster a culture of anti-racist action, encouraging teachers to collaboratively address systemic inequities in the school building. Student activism is encouraged and supported through project-based learning opportunities. Students organized and hosted the first ever state-wide student conference on racial justice in the Spring of 2019, bringing together students and activists from across Vermont. While the 2020 conference was postponed due to COVID-19, students continue to take action on injustice in their community through developing social justice lessons for younger students, writing letters to the editor, and supporting and amplifying the work of other activists in the state."
"Anonymous",2021,398,NA,NA,"Sam Houston is in year 1 of implementing the Third Future Schools model, which has completely changed the culture of the school and opportunities for students. The model focuses on personalized learning and direct instruction with a focus on meeting more than solely academic needs.   Personalized learning is an approach to instruction that is centered on the student. It taps into a student's needs, strengths, and interests to engage students and to provide a â€œbest fitâ€ education for each student. The instruction is tailored to the individual needs of the student, and students learn in a way that best meets their learning style. Third Future's personalized learning program features four distinguishing characteristics: 1. Learner Profile is a summary of the student's academic history, strengths, interests, social-emotional needs, and how he learns best. It is developed with the student and the parents in order to let the school know how to provide a tailored education that meets the individual student's needs and goals. 2. Student Learning Plan is the individualized, academic plan that will enable the student to reach academic proficiency and meet his other learning goals. It outlines the part of a student's curriculum that will be taught directly and the activities and lessons that will be customized for the student. 3. Flexible Learning Environment allows students to have a more tailored schedule and allows the teacher to use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction. Students may receive some instruction in a large group (25 students) or work in a small group, with a partner, or by himself. With the help of technology, and because the doors of the school will be open from 6:30 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., students may also learn before school, after school, or at home. 4. Competency-Based Education allows students to learn at their own pace. If a student has already mastered an objective or standard, they can move on to accelerated objectives or to a topic related to their other learning goals. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, she can take more time and received more individualized or small group instruction.   Third Future is also implements the """"dyad"""" concept that establishes requirements for experiences that are often only available to students with means, such as participating in sports, learning an instrument, traveling, and more. Third Future provides these experiences to students who are not able to afford them.   Students in the upper grades at Sam Houston also take a course called The Art of Thinking. To my knowledge, Third Future Schools spend the most time on teaching critical thinking and informational literacy, which is so critical to our current society.   Finally, Sam Houston is currently open from 6:30-4:30 (and even later outside of the current pandemic), which provides families free before and after school care. Sam Houston has done an incredible job operating (safely) during the pandemic and was featured in the local news paper. The school offered in person instruction much earlier than other local schools."

"Arkansas Team Digital",2021,407,NA,NA,"Overall, BJHS is relatively new to implementing blended learning, so for this school year, what stands out the most is the commitment to being flexible and providing multiple educational avenues for students that have allowed parents and students to select a learning environment that provides security and safety, but also provides a quality educational experience for our students. Teachers have moved to use Google Classroom as the primary interface with students. The Batesville School District has allowed students to choose between 3 different learning environments this school year, based on the parent and student preference. Most of our students are in person or remote, which for BJHS means the student is joining a physical classroom via Google Meet from an alternate location. This allows the student to take part in classroom discussions and have access """"real-time"""" to a teacher but doing so from the safety of their location of choice.  As far as doing things differently, BJHS is a one to one school. All students are issued a Chromebook, and the vast majority of our curriculum is provided via a digital format. Because BJHS had chosen to go one to one a few years ago, the staff and students were already in a situation to pivot to off-site learning when COVID struck our area. Though there were issues to resolve, our district was in a strong position to roll out digital learning to students. When this school year began, all students were given 3 options regarding how they would receive their education. Students were given the option of attending in person, attend """"remotely"""" (which is described above), or attending virtually.   Virtual instruction at BJHS consisted of students accessing courseware via Edgenuity or Lincoln Learning and working at their own pace.  This provided our families and students the ability to select the learning option that best suited their needs. There is no other district in our geographic area that I am aware of that provided this many students' options."
"Learning Policy Institute",2021,409,NA,NA,"Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School, located in Boyle Heights in East LA, is a full-service community school that places its students and their futures at the heart of its equity-oriented vision. Mendez operated as a community school long before it became one of the first members of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Community School cohort in 2019. This means that the school prioritizes the four pillars of a community school: integrated student supports (wraparound services), extended learning time and opportunity, distributed leadership, and family and community engagement. Students understand that their wellbeing is at the heart of the school's mission. In 2019, 85% of students reported feeling safe at Mendez and 81% of students reported that they are happy to be at Mendez (LAUSD School Experience Survey, 2019). At Mendez, student learning is also a priority, and the school's graduation rates have risen dramatically in the ten years since its founding in 2009. The school began with a graduation rate of nearly 50% and now has a graduation rate of over 84%, 90% of whom go to college.  As part of the school's focus on integrated student supports, Mendez High School partners with a number of different community organizations that provide services to students and their families. These community partners fulfill different roles on campus and can engage in case management, put on whole-school events, and offer group supports. Individual case management organizations, like Promesa Boyle Heights or Communities in Schools LA, provide one-on-one supports to students and families, often targeting dropout prevention and academic engagement through mental health supports or other interventions. The school also recently broke ground on a Wellness Center, where it will be able to provide mental and physical health resources to the Boyle Heights community. This Wellness Center is the result of over 10 years of organizing by the school and its community partners.   The school also holds high academic expectations for its students and launched two initiatives that target student learning gains: AP for All and Computer Science for All. As part of these initiatives, all Mendez students take at least one AP course and at least one Computer Science course prior to graduation. Many students choose to continue taking AP and Computer Science courses once they are exposed to the experience. Teachers and parents were concerned at the outset of the AP for All initiative that students would all choose to take AP Spanish, as the student population is predominantly Latino/a/x and there is a higher proportion of English Learners at Mendez than there are across the district and statewide. And yet, students have demonstrated an interest in a variety of AP courses since the initiative began. The school also focuses on the needs of students with disabilities and uses an inclusion model to ensure that students with special needs are given the same opportunities to learn as their peers.   Mendez's principal, Mauro Bautista, models a culture of distributed leadership. This is reflected in many of the aspects of the school, including its multiple governing bodies that include a variety of stakeholders throughout the community. There is a School Site Council, Local School Leadership, the School Culture Committee, the Family Action Team, and the House of Student Representatives. Many of the initiatives that are currently central to Mendez's approach are the result Principal Bautista seeking feedback from educators and families to guide decisions, including the school's Restorative Justice, Computer Science for All, and AP for All initiatives, which were all started by Mendez teachers.  The school has a hands-on approach to family and community engagement, which it leveraged when the pandemic closed LAUSD schools. Mendez staff and community partners reached out to every student and family, and if they could not contact anyone they did home visits. At these home visits, they provided an array of services, including delivering food or supplies and providing mental health check-ins. They also leveraged these relationships with families to determine how to deliver instruction in the Fall of 2020. Teachers, families, and students came together over the summer to determine the master schedule in the fall. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. They began planning for hybrid learning, where students will be on-campus part-time and their instruction will be aligned across the virtual and in-person learning environments.  Being on Mendez's campus is a joyful experience. Students whom you speak with readily share their learning, parents are frequently on campus volunteering or taking classes at its Family Center, and school leaders like Principal Bautista are often wandering the halls or working in the library because they both want to be accessible to the community and because they probably gave their office away to a community partner who is visiting campus. I'm excited to nominate Mendez because it is truly a community-based initiative that puts social and racial justice at the center of its decisions, which are all in service of the bright future of its students."

"Anonymous",2021,422,NA,NA,"ITDS is a top-tier public charter school in the nation's capital that is in its 10th year. The school is based on a model that prioritizes student inquiry and a deep respect for the student experience. The Inspired model is based on Intellect, Inquiry, Imagination and Integrity (the """"4 Is""""). Instruction is primarily through inquiry-based methods and active learning approaches, where the teacher serves as facilitator and coach to support student learning. Instruction includes an emphasis on social-emotional learning, and classrooms are student-centered with students working in small collaborative groups, individually, and through child-initiated play. This model, which was developed with concepts from improv, is a K-8 school that truly has a sense of student ownership and responsiveness. The twice yearly learning showcase hosted by the school gives students a chance to walk parents and community members through their own independent projects developed throughout the year.  ITDS has its own teacher residency program and as such serves as an embedded professional learning community that utilizes master teachers to mentor new teachers in Inspired teaching.

"Fielding International",2021,427,NA,NA,"Cranston Public Schools (CPS) is an average-sized American public school district of twenty-two schools that serve an economically and ethnically diverse population.  Cranston is the third-largest city in Rhode Island, and typical of most American cities, most of its schools were built in the 1950s and '60s. Despite the advanced age of many schools in the District, CPS leadership proclaimed that """"we must go beyond warm, safe and dry."""" We had just completed a comprehensive school facility plan, reinventing and reimagining Cranston's schools for the new twenty years and beyond. When approached by CPS District leadership to identify a potential â€œPathfinderâ€ or demonstration project, the Eden Park School presented a golden opportunity.   The School has a very progressive Principal and a teaching staff that was ready to reimagine and redefine their roles as teachers by letting go of the assumptions of what used to be school. They have fully embraced project-based learning and the five stages of finding a solution, real-time collaboration, and a flexible schedule to match their learning environment' flexibility.   Eden Park Learning Community is an ensemble of student-centered collaborative spaces. Moving away from the one teacher, one room, and sole care of one group of students, it is an environment that supports learner-agency, transparent technology, and fosters a wide variety of teaching and learning situations. These situations range from small group and independent study to whole group instruction or one-on-one with a teacher. The spaces also emphasize the importance of teacher collaboration by deprivatizing the planning process and include workspaces that allow teachers to work both independently and collaboratively.  The adoption of the Learning Community model at Eden Park has brought more flexibility and variety in day-to-day learning activities.  The old corridor was absorbed into the Learning Commons, leading to an agile space that supports multiple ways of learning, and multiple groups of learners.  This type of shared commons created a diffuse distribution of students and collaborative work areas.  Transparency between Learning Studios and the Commons facilitates interdisciplinary PBL learning for kids, adults, and folks who push-into these spaces for special services. The teachers have embraced industry experts and community partnerships in every way. Industry partners now plan with teachers, launch projects, and are utilized for feedback throughout each stage in the problem-solving process.   Teacher professional development through FI is embedded into the fabric of their work. Cranston is involved in ongoing professional development, which includes a three-year teacher coaching program. Teachers develop mastery in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum. Each year, the program becomes more student-centered, with learners identifying and defining problems and projects themselves by year three.   The results are in: at the 3rd-5th Grade Learning Community at the Eden Park School, the first completed, the level of engagement, personalization and physical comfort has reduced absences, seen a huge drop in disciplinary issues, and all but eliminated the need for specialized isolation and decompression rooms for students with special needs--instead, they are thriving within a suite of spaces shared by everyone in their learning community. The result is more learning, more joy, and less space required."

Real world skills training - the school prepares all students by providing each with a laptop of their own, certifications in all Microsoft Office applications, and financial literacy training in each year 3. Internships - all students participate in internships in a career area of curiosity and the school has built an impressive set of relationships with community partners, and 4. Investments in supports - the school does not maintain a library or have sports teams, instead it leverages the assets of the City's resources for students to access extracurricular activities with nonprofits and research at local libraries and colleges.

"Vermont Agency of Education",2023,583,NA,NA,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country were forced to re-evaluate their priorities and restructure their operations to do their part in keeping students safe. For White River Valley Middle School, this meant shifting their classes from the traditional school building to a series of outdoor classrooms housed in tents across the campus and students sorted into “pods” with peers that shared similar schedules to minimize potential for cross-contamination. These were emergency measures, initially designed with only the immediate health and safety of students in mind. However, the opportunities to advance innovative educational strategies were not lost on school leadership. The shift to outdoor classrooms allowed for a flourishing of place-based curriculum, with students being encouraged to see the living world around them as a co-equal partner in their educational process. The reorganized pod structure created a new, small-group space where students could build relationships and adult mentors could give students more consistent attention.  
 

 We are moving into the endemic phase of COVID-19, and many of the emergency measures are beginning to subside. The tents that dotted the White River Valley Middle School campus are gone and students have returned to receiving instruction inside the school building, but that’s not to say things have returned to the way they were before. Students and teachers are still encouraged to look at learning with a place-based lens, students are still being taught to look at nature as a source for knowledge, and once a week students are still meeting with their pods to engage in restorative practices.

This transformation was achieved through partnerships, deliberate planning, and student involvement in the design process.

Key points highlighted include:
1.Implementation of New Tech Network Model: The district adopted the New Tech Network whole-school model, embracing PBL from preschool through twelfth grade.
2. Partnerships and Funding: The district received intentional support from the Straight A Fund in Ohio's state biennial budget, enabling them to create customized, personalized learning experiences. Partnerships with construction and architecture firms like Skanska Megen Construction Co. Inc. and SHP helped build innovative, project-based learning spaces.
3.Student Involvement in Design Process: Students from grades 6-12 actively participated in the design process of the new buildings. The design was aligned with the educational vision, focusing on six key shifts in education and incorporating hallmarks of PBL instruction.
4.Identified Foundational Needs: Through this effort, foundational needs of students were recognized, including a desire for collaboration, a student-centric culture, engaging learning opportunities, various workshop sizes, mobility within the learning environment, active engagement, and access to technology in different forms.

The district's approach not only focused on physical infrastructural changes but also on aligning the design with the educational philosophy, ensuring that the learning spaces reflect the principles of project-based learning. The active involvement of students in the process indicates a commitment to meeting their needs and preferences.

Overall, the transformation of Winton Woods School District showcases a comprehensive effort to create an environment that supports innovative and student-focused learning experiences. In addition to the district-wide transformation, the high school campus stands out for its commitment to fostering mastery-based learning. Through a range of initiatives such as assessments designed for deeper learning, grading policies centered on mastery, and an array of supplementary resources including tutoring and extended learning opportunities, we ensure students have multiple avenues to demonstrate their mastery of subjects.

During the first quarter of this academic year, we're proud to share that over 500 high school students achieved an impressive grade of 3.0 or higher. This achievement reflects our dedication to supporting and recognizing student excellence in their academic pursuits.

"New Tech Network",2024,646,NA,NA," To create a school of innovative creators where all members of the community are respected and all students have warm demanders as facilitators, Compass Academy implemented new cultural practices at both the learner and adult level to establish a more supportive and inclusive culture. School leadership, teachers, and staff challenged students to embrace high standards for learning and college/career planning. Evidence for advancing student-centered learning can be observed with the adoption of and adaption of Marzano High Reliability Schools™ framework as a part of student, faculty and staff recognitions; using the framework indicators to empower their school teaching staff and students (Source: Marzano, R. J., Phil Warrik, and Julia A. Simms. A Handbook for High Reliability Schools: The Next Step in School Reform. Marzano Research, 2014.)  By adopting such a framework, the school has expanded the framework of standards to include competencies with performance assessments and academic skills that are transferable across content areas. Compass Academy students know exactly where they are and what they need to do next. This is an important component to enhancing supportive and inclusive culture experiences as this added “a level of fun and engagement that [the school] did not predict. It’s been an excellent investment in the human capital of Compass Academy.”  This leading indicator can be seen in action through restorative practice in the classrooms, using the “Good Things” protocol from Capturing Kids’ Hearts (Capturing Kids’ Hearts: A Three-Year Program Evaluation, 2016-17 to 2018-19, May 2020, https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED606969.pdf).  The “Project Expo” (senior capstone projects) allowed for new and potential students to share their best projects of the year to the public and school board; demonstrating Compass Academy’s school teaching tenets alignment to project-based learning.

Brake also states that the students benefit from the networking aspect inherent in community partnerships. “Students will develop pathways to careers locally, and get people to become their champions — people that will help them access college, internships and eventually, a career, if they build and maintain those connections.”
At OIA, those partnerships are an essential piece to students’ college and career readiness skills, valued so highly that school leadership lobbied the district to provide a part-time staff position to manage and grow community partnerships.  
“I was handling the curriculum and the duties that come with being principal, but I knew this piece was so important. We needed dedicated resources.” The school’s community partnerships liaison splits time between teaching special education and managing community relationships for OIA; many, who Benjamin cites, return each year to collaborate on projects. “We were fortunate to have a community that bought in from the very beginning, and now, they have someone they can contact, and say, ‘we want to get on board’.”
OIA’s successful community partnerships program includes the local headquarters of businesses like Southern Star Pipeline (who provide volunteer judges and help with the school’s robotics tournaments), Puzzle Pieces, a nonprofit dedicated to helping children and adults with disabilities (where students have donated 3D puzzles they’ve created for clients) and the Chamber of Commerce that connects students with business leaders in the area. 
The sustainable structure of OIA’s project-based learning academy is a result of years of hard work, dedicated leaders and community partners, and a commitment to working through a process that provides the best outcomes for its students. “You can’t just copy [a model] and think it’s going to work,” said Benjamin. “You have to work through the process. And we wouldn’t be where we are today without our community, and those relationships, along with our curriculum and the rigor that’s part of that. New Tech Network is definitely the one to credit for that.”

Last, to combat the ongoing educational obstacles stemming from the pandemic, specialized academic instruction was amended to reflect remote/distance learning which included push-in Zoom support in designated Zoom courses (e.g., English, Math, Science, Spanish) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in accordance to student’s IEPs.

The Educational Specialist, Resource Specialist and Instructional Assistants also monitored the academic progress of SWD weekly, communicated on a regular basis with teachers, and communicated with SWD families/guardian on a regular basis.  Approximately 64% of students enrolled at Samueli Academy are Unduplicated Students (low-income, English learner, Foster youth). The following is a description of the services we provided to meet the needs of  Unduplicated Pupils (UP). The Leadership Team in collaboration with support staff communicated regularly to assess and document student needs and ensure appropriate supports and resources were provided in a timely manner. The Student Success Coordinator also serves as the Homeless and Foster Youth Liaison and has closely monitored this vulnerable student population through check-ins, to ensure they had access to curricular and instructional materials, Chromebook, internet access, access to food, clothing and shelter, academic and social-emotional support, during school closure. These students received priority for the dissemination of Wi-Fi Hotspots, funds through our partnership with United Way.  The   English Learners received both designated and integrated English Language Development (ELD) via distance learning using English 3D ELD Curriculum. English Learners received additional written instruction and video support during Distance Learning. Designated ELD and academic support for ELs was provided by a credentialed teacher and the Student Development Coordinator. Their teachers provide daily office hours in addition to small group and 1:1 instruction. Samueli’s bilingual school support staff also communicated with families on a regular basis to identify family needs and provide resources.
