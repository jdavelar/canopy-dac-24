Students are known as individuals and while there are common learning expectations for all students, teachers work to build upon each student's skills and capacities. Students learn agency along with deep content and skills, Casco Bay is a wonderful example of a school creating its own successful version of a very successful national school and learning template -- the EL Schools model. It is a district school, not a charter, in the Portland public schools and so is subject to all of the same regulations, policies, and contracts that all regular public schools are subject to. And yet the experience its students have at Casco Bay is very different than the ""normal"" experience most kids have in schools these days. Casco Bay, like all EL schools, is very deeply experiential and project-based -- most learning is connected to some form of authentic purpose. It has done exceptional work in thinking about and designing ways to gauge student growth across a number of dimensions not normally on the radar in public schools. It is doing all of this work with a student body that -- while it has opted into the school -- reflects much of the diversity, complexity, and challenges  that many public schools must address right now. We have brought teams of educators to Casco Bay many times over the past five years and these educators routinely leave feeling inspired and with a whole new view of what schools can be. A video of Casco Bay's community grappling, in typically student-led ways, with a racist incident was featured in our recent virtual film festival, This Is Our Chance. See ""Walking in Solidarity"" on this page of the festival site: https://our-chance.com/week-1/."

Impact | Puget Sound Elementary,101,"Charter School Growth Fund, NewSchools Venture Fund and an anonymous organization","Spring 2023,Spring 2024","Impact | Puget Sound Elementary (PSE) is the flagship campus for Impact Public Schools, the first homegrown Washington state elementary charter network. After opening in 2018, Impact | PSE has proven that its model has the ability to narrow, and eventually close, the opportunity gap for historically marginalized students in south Puget Sound. Impact | PSE uses a model rooted in three design principles:  [1] Relationships: Fostering secure attachments within a tight-knit community of learners using a small group mentor model. [2] Agency: Working with families and students to develop comprehensive, personalized learning pathways for each individual scholar [3] Liberation: Creating deep, authentic learning experiences for students that lead to activism through the exploration of contextualized topics that are relevant in students� communities.  The Impact | PSE model employs an expanded definition of student success. While Core Skills are critical to student success, Impact | PSE also believes that deeper learning skills and social-emotional skills are essential to support the next generation of equity-driven, innovative leaders. These three design principles are the foundation for achieving this vision of student success.   Impact | PSE�s implementation of a decolonized project-based learning (PBL) program is a stand-out element of the school model. The PBL curriculum has been designed to shift the dominant perspective and highlight voices, stories, and information that has not been emphasized in how students traditionally learn history. These projects lift up the indigenous perspective and work to break down institutional racism many educational systems continue to perpetuate. Impact | PSE operates with the belief that all scholars deserve to see themselves and their experiences reflected in what is being taught in their classrooms. All students deserve to learn about and be exposed to writers, artists, historians, community heroes and leaders who share their background and identity. In order for the Impact | PSE curriculum to be liberating, it must be rooted in the local communities it serves. At Impact | PSE, instructional leaders ensure that the liberated PBL model is replicable by developing a rigorous and relevant base curriculum that includes assessment tools, lesson plans and exemplars. Then, the school provides systems, structures (including a process for community/parent design input) and professional development to ensure the projects are rooted in the school community. This two-part method ensures that the curriculum is not rooted in the command, control and regurgitation of facts, but instead in the exploration of important, relevant questions that allow students to create real products and showcase them in front of a live audience of peers, parents and community members., The instructional model has been designed to ensure that every student has the opportunity to meet career- and college-ready standards. The model is based on three essential design elements that have been selected to nurture 21st century skills and habits within a culturally-responsive learning environment: 1. School-based mentor groups, 2. Personalized learning pathways for every student and 3. Project-based learning (PBL)."

During these times, 15 minutes is designated to talk about stress and what to do about it. Teachers and students both learn how to empathize with others through these discussions. There is a student lounge with a maker space, therapy dogs, and a weight room where students can go to relieve stress. They also have the ability to leave class with no questions asked. The school staff believe that de-escalation must occur before issues can be addressed. School suspensions are spent in a separate room in the building where students can complete their work. Students can bring their babies to school and have been known to address the entire student body about LGBTQ and BLM issues. Students have access to a food pantry which also contains personal items and clothing. The staff and students at Horizons feel safe, accepted, have a sense of belonging, and are responsible for themselves and others.

 1. 100% of Rooted School students are enrolled in technology-centered courses that are oriented towards students earning Industry Based Credentials. Students have the option take classes in 3D-printing, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Unity Virtual Video Game Design, Comp TIA+, and others. Students can earn up to 8 industry based credentials during their time at Rooted. 
 

 2. Students participate in self-directed learning and project based learning in all classes. Self-directed learning modules give students the opportunity to move at their own pace, and for teachers to provide students individualized instruction. Students also practice time-management skills. Project based learning experiences mimic the types of challenges and projects students will experience once they graduate. 
 

 3. Rooted School uses a competency based grading system. Students are graded on their demonstration of mastery of the subject matter, and have the opportunity to resubmit assignments to earn a higher grade. This grading system mimics how students will be expected to approach their tasks once in a career. 
 

 4. Students apply the knowledge they learn in their technology courses to internal and external internships. Internal internships include a digital media internship and IT help desk internship. Students get paid to use the skills they learned in their courses, while also preparing for their future career. 
 

 5. Rooted School is facilitating a direct-cash transfer program in collaboration with the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania.

The UPenn team will evaluate the impact of the cash transfers on students’ perceived financial wellbeing, attendance, and academic achievement. This program seeks to explore the structures that schools can implement that advance equity, as well as students’ well-being. The results of this study will open the door to conversations regarding larger policy and budgetary shifts within education., We exist to see our students academically prepared and financially free. Some students will arrive at financial freedom with a college next to their name, others without. Our job is not to decide how they will get there but to provide them with the options to get there. We teach students how to learn in an ever-changing world, develop their skills in the most in-demand job sectors and create technology that is transformational. Our first school offers opportunities for students across the digital sector. Many students will graduate with highly sought-after jobs in technology—paying well above the local living wage. Many students will go on to college with a sense of purpose and a relevant context for being there. All will leave with a job offer in one hand and a college acceptance letter in the other., Rooted School New Orleans stands out in how it reimagines the purpose, instructional core, and structure of 'school' by prioritizing equity and student-centered learning. It combines a rigorous academic program that offers college and career readiness, including the opportunity to earn an associate's degree and industry-based certifications.

Oxford Virtual Academy,383,MiCoOp,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","Oxford Virtual Academy (OVA) began 10 years ago as a virtual school, but has transformed into a true personalized learning environment that includes virtual, seated, blended, project-based, independent study, dual enrollment courses and more. Some courses use third-party vendor curriculum, but they also create custom courses for students or groups of students. The school has a drop-in learning space and offers courses with community partners.   OVA has a high level of academic rigor and requires 24 credits to graduate, but they offer many options for students to get there (i.e., multiple pathways to graduation). As Janet would describe, they are like the super highway to graduation because they offer the tools and capacity for students to choose their path and pace to graduation. Their student body is made up of students from different ethnic, socio-economic, and academic levels, yet each receives a personalized program to fit their needs. For example, traditionally homeschooled students may choose to enroll with OVA because they still have control over their learning with support from certified teachers. Students who want more rigor than the traditional school enroll to move ahead faster. The school has partnerships with foster care and court programs where they provide the path for those students to continue their education. One student may take courses from three different vendors while another is taking two online courses, two college courses, an art course at a local community partner, and getting credit for a job through a work-based program.   I am always amazed at the perseverance and commitment they have for each individual student. Whether a student is in kindergarten or 10th grade, they don�t have to fit into the school�s box for learning. They can create their own path with the support from OVA�s administrators, counselors, teachers, and mentors. "

Students can choose from fully online courses, blended learning opportunities, dual enrollment, Early College or advanced course options, and other Gull Lake Community Schools buildings� offerings.   The flexibility offered by GLVP is attractive to K-12 full-time students, part-time students, home school students, and nonpublic/shared time students who want to discover their own individual talents. A range of virtual learning platforms are available to meet the needs of students. The school partners with community experts to offer optional learning experiences that allow virtual students to apply their learning. These elective virtual courses are designed in collaboration between a community expert and a GLVP teacher so that accurate content and effective online course design are both present. In addition to taking the online course, students have the option to attend an in-person session with the community expert. Unique course offerings include Reverse Engineering, Wilderness Survival and Adventuring, Confectionery Art, and Latin.   While many traditional schools say they are preparing their students for career and college, they try to fit the student into their programs. GLVP creates the program to fit the student. In their Early College program, students can choose from three different universities to receive an associates degree. Courses are offered both online and face-to-face with many supports from both GLVP and the colleges. In their senior year, students can choose to take a math for college success course that was created in partnership between the high school, GLVP, and a local community college."

On the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V)accountability measure for nontraditional program concentration, River Bend Career and Technical Center has the highest performance in Vermont. Defined as ""CTE concentrators enrolled in programs leading to a field non-traditional for their gender, as well as non-binary, non-conforming, and transgender students,"" River Bend Career and Technical Center's three year average is 21.01%, compared to the overall state average of 11.71%.  River Bend Career and Technical Center believes this data represents work the center has done to create a safe, respectful, inclusive culture. Despite the fact that they have the highest performance on this measure in the state, the school's leadership team recognizes that there is more work to be done. Their Perkins V Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment identified areas for improvement, and their four year plan calls for continued work to increase the number of students enrolling in programs that are nontraditional for their gender.  In addition, after full staff training on preventing bullying and harassment and identifying and intervening when bullying and harassment occur, River Bend Career Technical Center gave deliberate consideration to creating learning environments that are safe and respectful for every student. As a result of this work, River Bend Career and Technical Center determined that they needed to have zero tolerance for displays of the Confederate flag (e.g. on student clothing, backpacks, notebooks, vehicles, etc.). Brian Emerson, the school's Director (Principal), reports that it was hard work, but they stayed the course. He notes that the work River Bend Career and Technical Center has done over the past five years has positioned them to continue to address issues of equity and inclusion and to work toward racial equity in a very rural community with limited racial diversity."

Hazen Union recently piloted a student-centered driven, student-designed, advanced manufacturing course and makerspace using student personalized learning plans (PLPs) as a tool for students to co-design and co-develop curriculum with teachers and community partners. This pilot expanded upon Hazen�s well-established Work-Based Learning (WBL) Program and Independent Based Learning (IBL) Program. In response to COVID-19, Hazen Union and community partners leveraged the grant funded equipment to print face shields for Vermont doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The community partners worked with the students virtually throughout the process, providing opportunities to engage in design-thinking methods and skill attainment that could be applied across contexts. Upon completion of the pilot, the student cohort presented their curriculum, reflections, and deliverables to OSSU School Board members with recommendations to support the sustainability of this program. Students were empowered to demonstrate their competency in communication, advocacy, and action research in order to maintain this student-centered program for their peers. The success of this program conveys the importance of education and community partnerships and the positive impact student voice has within the school system and the community at large. This year, the program has tripled in size with the support of community partnerships. This unique learning model allows students to develop competency across content areas, technical skills, and transferable skills. Even throughout the pandemic Hazen Union continues to provide students the agency to personalize their learning inclusive of the instructional dispositions and learning models available within their WBL and IBL Programs.

We were awarded a 6-year grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation that funded opportunities for teacher growth as innovators and leaders, one-to-one technology, and an outreach effort that extended into the community�s living rooms and conference rooms to ask �What do our students need to succeed?�  The answers to that question were distilled into our six Graduate Expectations, or GXs: Communication, Critical Thinking, Culture & Community, Creativity, Persistence, and Wellbeing. Currently, students demonstrate the first two in order to graduate, with all required by 2022. Each is assessed through a multi-stage performance-based assessment and final demonstration of learning during our Expo Weeks in January and June. Students are also assessed for graduation in 19 academic proficiency areas and through skill tests in reading and mathematics.  Our innovations include the iLab for fully personalized learning, a self-paced Math Lab for students at all levels, integration of technology in language learning, and numerous student-driven core courses. We also invest in student voice and leadership training, which is integrated with our expanded advisory curriculum. With support from the Rowland and Barr Foundations, Winooski is currently mapping and engaging with a wide variety of community-based partners to provide flexible pathways to graduation.  In all our practices, we aim to motivate students to achieve by fostering their engagement and ownership of learning., Winooski has been a leader in supporting learner-centered, competency-based learning, equity-centered design, deep community engagement, restorative practices, and flexible pathways to graduation.

The WMHS Computer-Based Music-Making Program launched in 2021, driven by student interest. The Computer-Based Music Making Program is a class offered to students that allows them to create, record, and produce their own music or audio recordings using computer technology. Approximately 45% of WMHS students have resettled in Winooski through the refugee resettlement program. Among them, they speak around 20 languages, predominantly Swahili, Somali, French, and Nepali. For these students, music is a common language. For some Winooski students, who struggle academically, music has been an anchor, keeping them connected to the district and providing an outlet for their talent. Many students want to make music in their own languages or write songs that students can sing in class. This program has enabled students to express themselves and connect with other students, and the broader community and is an excellent way to be inclusive and provide equitable access to arts education.
 

 Additionally, Winooski’s promise to their community includes: 
 Students have voice and choice in their learning.  
 • Students are excited about the topics they are learning as they are tied to their interests and their futures. 
 • Learning is personalized and is relevant and meaningful to each student. 
 • Each student develops a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs, interests and passions. 
 • Students own their learning, are confident, and are willing to take on leadership roles.

 • Students advance at their own pace, with guidance from their advisor. 
 • Students move toward graduation as they master each topic. 
 • Classes are small in size and enable teachers to engage and challenge each student’s learning style and ability.

CLK Engage at CLK Elementary School,535,Horizons Alternative Education School and MiCoOp,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","CLK Engage has merged critical stakeholder input with the traits of a student-centered, competency-based learning environment to tailor a personalized learning program specific to our needs coming out of pandemic learning.  Many of our parents where tired of the amount of online learning and dependency upon technology during the pandemic.  So, the challenge our team faced was how to create a personalized learning program without a dependence on technology.  They met this challenge with the establishment of a multi-age program that personalizes learning with a focus on ELA and Math through flexible, in-person scheduling. , CLK Elementary School began CLK Engage beginning the 2021-22 school year. This microschool is an opt-in option for parents with students in grades 1-3. They plan to add grades 4 and 5 next school year. There are currently three teachers and 60 students in the microschool. After a 10-15 minute morning meeting where all gather, students go to their homeroom. Students move during the day based on assessment data in reading and math. For example, a ""first-grade"" student performing above grade level in reading will attend the ""second-grade"" teacher's reading class while a ""third-grader"" needing more time to develop foundational math skills will attend a ""second-grade"" math class. Students move along the scope and sequence continuum in these subjects without being held back or forced to move forward because of their traditional grade level. 

All students receive whole group and small group instruction from their teachers. Instruction in core subjects other than reading and math is received from their homeroom teacher and students still participate in elective courses like physical education and art. While technology is used in the classroom as a resource and for supplementary activities, students spend most of their time physically with their teachers. Place-based learning opportunities are embedded into the CLK Engage program through local field trips and “Fun Friday” activities. 

While the demographics for most of the students are similar, every student is on a different learning journey. CLK Engage is addressing the individual learning paths for all students, helping them to reach their highest potential., This school is already in the Canopy project for this program, but they added another grade level this year.
 

 CLK Engage is a microschool within Calumet’s elementary school. They began by combining grades 1-3 in 2021. Grade 4 was added in 2022. All CLK Engage students meet first thing in the morning, creating community. The schedule is structured so all four classes have math at the same time (and reading at the same time) so students can move from one level to another based on their needs. Teachers assess students on a regular basis and reassign them based on their progress."

In courses, students have the opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills for proficiency through a variety of learning experiences and assessments. Each department has delineated two to eight discipline-specific proficiencies that a student is required to meet for graduation. When a student receives credit for a particular course that is an indication that the proficiencies have been met. Taken together, the proficiencies or credits gained will provide a cumulative body of evidence that students have met overall school-wide and discipline-specific graduation expectations and are ready to graduate. 
 

 All students at CHS develop a Personalized Learning Plan. This plan documents a CHS student’s journey. The options for students include but are not limited to, community service, outside coursework, student aide assignments, work-study, independent study, online learning, Advanced Placement courses, Technical Centers, Dual-Enrollment courses, Early College, and internships. In addition, students may apply to Target Graduation, an outcomes-based graduation program, or may apply to attend Colchester Alternative Program (CAP) a smaller learning environment.
 

 The work of educators at Colchester High School is guided by the following Core Beliefs:
 ● We engage in diverse learning experiences rooted in relationships, relevance, rigor, and shared responsibility.
 ● We work together to build on one another's strengths and perspectives.
 ● We cultivate a strong and connected community that respects and celebrates all Lakers.
 ● We demonstrate respect and compassion for ourselves, one another, and our school.
 ● We create safe spaces where all Lakers can thrive.
 ● We empower all Lakers to use their voice, pursue their aspirations, and be active and engaged members of our community.
 

 Educational decisions are guided by the belief that proficiency-based learning practices in an environment of strong support for students’ social and emotional needs will enable them to meet these expectations."

One World Middle School,660,Deeper Learning Equity Fellowship,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","As a school community, One World Middle School has reimagined the learning of what education looks like in how students experience school as a whole. At the foundational core, they believe that students have the right to a quality and innovative standards-based education, the right to know and be known in a safe and welcoming environment, and the right to be acknowledged as unique individuals who learn differently. These core beliefs promote and advance equity and student-centered learning throughout the school. It is evident upon walking through the halls, the classrooms, and interacting with the students that their core beliefs live and breathe through how they view the purpose of education and the instructional core, and the structures they deem important.
 

 One World Middle School has proven that in order to have a reimagined equitable learning environment, two components must be in place: a safe learning environment and a staff that knows who the children are and their individual needs. To support this idea they have implemented practices and events such as Ambassador Day, Unit 0, and Developing the Whole Child Meeting (DWC). Ambassador Day is quite the experience as students across all grades are given the opportunity to select their mentors for the year. During this particular day, students engage in community-building activities by spending the entire day in small groups with their teacher mentor discussing their commonalities and differences and learning to embrace each other diversity and strengths. Throughout the year the mentors meet weekly to plan and conduct themed-based activities. For example, in November and December, mentor groups coordinate events and activities around gratitude and acts of kindness respectively. These student-led initiatives have taken different forms over the years from groups creating donation drives, reading to students at neighborhood elementary schools, making edible treats that are distributed to fellow peers, volunteering at Senior Health Centers to simply redesigning a classroom space. 
 

 In thinking about how to continually engage students and to make sure all learners see themselves in the curriculum, One World Middle School acknowledges and celebrates the various cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity that comprises the school community through their first unit of the year. One World Middle School in all grades and content areas uses the first unit of the year which is called Unit 0 to focus on student identity and understanding the child. In addition, there are weekly meetings programmed called Developing the Whole Child (DWC) where teacher teams create action plans for ambassadors who may need support academically, socially, or emotionally. These strategies are often grounded in the Pre-referral Intervention Manual (PRIM) or Adaptation for Adolescents with Autism and Asperger's manual (A-5) to tailor the support to effectively meet the needs of the student. The teams continually discuss the outcomes of the strategy with each other as well including the student for their input. Teams reflect on progress as they monitor the impact on student learning.  
 

 At One World it is evident that they are thoughtful about the language they use with their students and in their space. It is a common belief that the process for creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that equitably supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults begins with language which is clearly intertwined in the fabric of the school. The school truly believes that the words students encounter on daily basis, they will in turn embody. Thus, students are addressed as ambassadors because they are encouraged and provided with opportunities to be agents of change. The word ambassador coincides with the school's construction as they operate under a United Nations model where ambassador voices are influential in the way the school functions and the changes that occur. An example of a system in place is the school's embassy delegates which include members from all grades that meet biweekly with the principal. These meetings range from discussing issues and making suggestions, to planning events such as LGBTQ Coming Out Day, Autism Awareness Day, or Breast Cancer Awareness Day which is driven by the consensus of the student body. These student-centered planned events foster a level of self and others. Every morning during morning assembly the school gathers together to proclaim as one voice, ""I want today to be one of the greatest days of my life"" to establish a positive feeling and tone for the day. As a mantra, to work and live by, the school leadership believes and promotes that each year they must create a learning environment and community that is more impactful than the previous year. 
 

 It is without a doubt, that the ambassador's academic outcome is at the core of One World Middle School's instructional focuses and practices. They have demonstrated that ambassadors learn best when they have an opportunity to collaborate with peers and then make their thinking visible. Practices in place to support that students constantly engage with other students start with the structure of how the room is designed. At One World all classes are designed to accommodate a variety of grouping configurations. These configurations support opportunities over the course of a lesson for ambassadors to engage in turn and share and work on group assignments as well as projects in a seamless manner. Teachers have collaborated on phased protocols to promote partner discussions. As a best practice, all classrooms are equipped with two certified teachers to ensure that on a daily basis all needs of their children are met. Teachers take a less active role in talking in the classroom being mindful of the fact that the one that is speaking, is the one doing most of the learning. Therefore, in a One World classroom ambassadors are often engaged in discussions about the planned tasks, and activities in an effort to meet the day's objective where the teachers utilize a series of questions or prompt to cognitively challenge students thinking to either spark ambassador questions or to promote metacognition. 
 

 Ambassadors making connections and providing opportunities is an extremely critical component of the school. For example, the entire student body annually engages in Science Day where ambassadors take their learning to design experiments and projects. Additionally, all students participate in a school-wide dissection that is tiered by grade to investigate the systems, and scientific benefits to society and to ponder the ethical consequences. All ambassadors in the 8th grade take high-school level courses (Living Environment, US History, English 11, Algebra). As a result, 8th graders start their high school careers a grade ahead which allows them to have access to a college course for free or graduate a year early. Students at One World have the opportunity to visit colleges they have expressed interest in that are located locally and across state lines. Some of the colleges toured include Boston College, Harvard, Yale, SUNY Oneota, Howard, and many others. From touring colleges students who have graduated have enrolled in colleges such as Boston College and other SUNY programs. Through their expeditionary trips to monumental sites in history, like Selma, Gettysburg, and The Capitol ambassadors have been able to make connections to topics discussed in their classes.
 

 Other practices that are embedded at One World include a dedicated department and common planning time for teachers to meet, plan and revise units that are tailored specifically for the students they teach. Student-initiated clubs and student electives where ambassadors get an opportunity to express their interests and preferences for electives in a series of exit interviews."

With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, choice boards, and student interests were targeted strategies. With the COVID pandemic in 2020, BLPS soon realized they would need to dig deeper into the development and implementation of learning pathways to support all learners. Concerned about learning loss when virtual school was the only option, teachers engaged in professional collaboration to address those learning gaps. Prioritizing standards in ELA and Mathematics was a first step in the construction of an equitable viable Learning Continuum, where progressions of learning and readiness assessments were developed for the standards. As teachers continued to collaborate in both grade level and vertical teams, it was clear the curriculum work they had done served a larger purpose than addressing learning gaps – it had in fact provided an opportunity to foster agency in all learners! Date tracking and goal setting soon belonged to the 4- and 5-year-old kindergartners, first and second graders, and progress monitoring and celebrations of learning soon followed, where the outcome was student ownership of the learning! Generative curriculum, where the youngest of learners bring ideas to school about what they want to learn taps into curiosity and has made room for projects that are truly learner-centered at BLPS.

Rio Rico High School,754,KnowledgeWorks,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","At Rio Rico High School, located in the Santa Cruz Valley Unified School District No 35, in Rio Rico, Arizona, students and staff all know how to ""REP”.  Based on the core values of Relationships, Excellence, and Pride the faculty embraces creating the best learning environments possible for their students.  Three years ago, as the school began thinking more critically about equitable outcomes for all learners, they expanded and deepened opportunities for students to own their learning.  Flexibility with time resulted in RRHS allowing students to build individualized learning schedules depending on their interests and situation. All grade levels offer three distinct options - face to face instruction, distance learning, and flex-scheduling - to provide students agency when deciding on the environment that best meets their needs. Wednesdays provide intervention and enrichment services for students and personalized professional development for staff.
 
In anticipation of transitioning to a standards-based system for reporting on learning, the principal facilitated a voluntary book study on Grading for Equity, by Joe Feldman.  Avant-garde teachers now implement more equitable grading practices to their level of comfort and understanding.  This behavior has grown the network of interested teachers and expanded the grass roots of implementation in advance of a full transition in SY24.  

Administration also emphasizes student voice.  Beyond creative student scheduling, a student senate meets regularly to offer insight and guidance on decision-making, student artwork beautifies the campus in multiple areas, and a student cheering section actively drives school spirit!  Through the combination of voice and choice, the students REP in palpable ways.
 
With a focus on an instructional shift to a more student-centered environment, flexible seating, distance/flex scheduling, SOPs, and student voice remain the primary strategies advancing the school-wide mantra ""We REP!""

Cibola High School,756,KnowledgeWorks,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","For the past four years, Cibola High School, one of six high schools in Yuma Union High School district, has been reimagining education by putting systems in place to support learner-centered practices. Key in the shift is a focus on mastery learning and an expectation of student success – no matter what it takes. Three years ago, a small group of teachers and the principal began studying and applying standards-based grading principles. Today, over 60 percent of the staff participate. The shift has evolved into equitable systems of grading and assessment across the campus, resulting in student agency and ownership of the learning. Students know the vision is for them to attain the highest level of proficiency/mastery. If they don’t succeed on the first attempt, they’ll have choice and opportunity to reassess. The staff believes that all students can succeed, and they insist on rigor by not allowing them to fail. Students own their learning and share their data with parents in regular emails. Collaboration, project-based learning, and flexible seating environment enable learners to flourish academically. 

Developing leadership and ensuring voice are critical at Cibola. The Courtesy Corps of student leaders in each classroom greet visitors and explain the focus of the day’s learning. Administration ensures student voice shapes the school culture. For example, a student focus group will roll out the new Portrait of a Graduate to the student body and provide ideas on systems to embed the POG in Cibola daily life. Adult agency has grown from teachers learning from teachers (TLFT). Teachers lead professional learning opportunities, participate in peer-to-peer classroom observations and feedback loops, and choose their personal learning pathways to grow their practice. Leaders provide time and support for the adult learning; as a result, teachers completed 82 digital PCBL learning modules in November. The Culture and Climate at Cibola High School has purposefully shifted. Staff believes that all students can succeed, and the focus is on developing the “whole student”, with student growth being the priority.

San Luis High School,757,KnowledgeWorks,"Spring 2023,Spring 2024","San Luis High School, one of six high schools in the Yuma Union High School District, serves 2551 students in the southwestern corner of Arizona, bordering Mexico. The school’s mission states: “Challenging students to think and learn for themselves.” The staff has implemented learner-centered practices and systems to make this mission a reality. The academic program provides multiple learning pathways that enable every learner to be college, career, and community ready on a personal path.  Learners track their data and regularly set goals during time designated across the campus. All teachers offer choice through Universal Design for Learning, allowing students options in how to access, engage, and demonstrate learning. Choice boards, multiple assessment opportunities, and collaboration in small groups based on data provide a just-right learning environment. The early shifts to standards-based grading are providing an equitable system of assessment and reporting. 

Agency is a natural outcome of the options at San Luis. Besides the conventional structures such as Student Council and National Honor Society, student voice is intentionally amplified through the principal’s Student Advisory group, where students are leading a positive campus culture. Students co-created school-wide standard operating procedures for campus issues like cell phone usage, hallways, etc., to ensure a safe, productive environment. The robust Career Technical Student Organizations provide a platform for leadership growth and demonstration of personal achievement through national competitions. Four of these clubs received the 2022 Gold Chapter of Distinction award based on student performance. Both inside and outside the classroom, every learner can choose to excel at San Luis High School.

Central Vermont Career Center,389,Vermont Agency of Education,Spring 2024,"As a local control state, when Vermont transitioned to proficiency based graduation requirements, each school district was left to develop its own specific requirements, informed by resources provided by the Agency of Education. Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion.

Missisquoi Valley Union Middle and High School,395,Vermont Agency of Education,Spring 2024,"The leadership team at Missisquoi Valley Union (MVU) Middle and High School was able to hold two preliminary meetings and a train-the-trainer workshop focused on equity literacy with Paul Gorski. All members of the MVU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (DEI) Committee have a solid understanding of the principles and practices of equity literacy in education.  Educators from Swanton and Sheldon were intensively introduced to these principles and practices.  At MVU, several members of the DEI Committee feel fully prepared to plan and offer equity literacy professional learning to the staff. Additionally, an equity student survey was created, and feedback provided by the Equity Literacy Institute.  Educators secured funding to get the results of the survey professionally analyzed through an equity lens.   MVU has met the expectation of Proficiency-Based Learning with a thoughtful transition.  Early work was done 7 years ago to prioritize standards and create clear learning expectations, learning scales for common summative assessments, and school-wide habits of work.  Over the past 4 years, educators have implemented a more refined version of proficiency-based learning which includes a transition to proficiency-based grades, personalized course offerings, and robust and flexible �keeping up and catching up� interventions.  As a highlight, the English Language Arts department has wholeheartedly embraced independent reading.  Students now meet their reading proficiencies by providing evidence from books that they choose.  Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: �	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. �	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. �	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: �	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. �	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. �	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: �	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. �	Begin Equity student focus groups. �	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. �	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. �	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. �	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL�s 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.  MVU is in its 4th year of working with Think: Kids and using the Collaborative Problem-Solving approach with students.  Three staff are training to become certified Think: Kids trainers in order to grow the capacity to use Collaborative Problem Solving schoolwide. "

However, I think they definitely should be included on Canopy's list, especially for those individuals looking for strategies to support math growth for low-income Black students in lower elementary grades. Promise's students posted 2019 math achievement rates higher than schools in DC's predominantly white and affluent Ward 3. The team's approach to morning-afternoon split math instruction is fairly novel. Educators teach a lesson in the morning and utilize data from exit tickets to design the afternoon's math activities. The school's extended day and year structure affords the time needed to turn data into action that ultimately closes historic racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps."

Woodstock Union Middle/High School,471,Vermont Agency of Education,Spring 2024,"The Windsor Central leadership team began the process of developing a Portrait of a Graduate and related strategic plan during the 2018-2019 school year. This effort allowed students, parents, educators, and community members in the newly formed Windsor Central Modified Unified Union District to collectively construct a vision of their graduates and a plan for enabling learners to meet those expectations. The strategic plan that was developed provides a clear roadmap with the Portrait of a Graduate being their �north star.� Leadership recognized the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in a meaningful process to achieve positive change. I was fortunate to be able to attend sessions and observe the high-level of commitment by all involved.   A systems perspective is also evident in Windsor Central�s strategic plan through intentional connections between strategies and the Portrait of a Graduate competencies. For instance, Strategy 1.2 states, �Achieve a high level of math proficiency for all students through curriculum review, classroom instructional practices, professional development, and robust interventions so that all students reach their full potential.� The related Portrait Competency, Academic Excellence, is identified in order to ensure coherence between strategies and competencies.   At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects. This �Teacher�s Toolkit� is aimed at providing strategies for fostering skills and dispositions within the PoG. It was developed by educators as a resource to bring the PoG to life in classrooms. The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  ?	Create a culture of �Deep Learning� in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; ?	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; ?	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; ?	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; ?	Develop a list of �instructional lenses�;  ?	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  ?	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpacks� tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them. Place-based learning supports the development of a sense of wonder, grows students� social-emotional skills, increases engagement, and builds a better understanding of the world.   Windsor Central Unified Union School District has engaged in racial equity work with the support of Writing Wrongs, LLC. The Windsor Central School Board�s anti-racist work is focused on creating anti-racist policy. They have received a grant to dig further into current anti-racist efforts, starting with school board members and leadership within the system. An equity audit will be used to gather data regarding the current status.   The Leadership Team commits to adopting a more visible stance of active listening, collective learning, internal reflection, and critical evaluation of current practice. This stance and any action plans will be developed with the help of partnerships with individuals and organizations centered on this work to expose systemic racism embedded in our educational system. Leadership commits to providing students with an education that is explicitly anti-racist and refuses to turn away from the hard truths of our history. "

West Michigan Virtual Academy,478,MiCoOp,Spring 2024,"Not many virtual schools offer a drop-in center for middle school students. West Michigan Virtual Academy (WMVA) serves middle and high school students, grades 6-12. When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around students� social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.  Their drop-in center is located at the city�s recreation center so WMVA has the ability to offer their virtual lifetime fitness classes with an in-person component. They also offer optional career field trips and guest speakers for all 300 students. Before COVID, the drop-in lab would regularly see 30-40 students who came in for assistance, many of them showing up multiple times a week. WMVA also has partnerships with the local career tech center and three local colleges where students can earn career skills and/or college credits. "

This gives students the opportunity to work with partners and collaborate at high levels using analytical and critical thinking skills. Alturas Prep will expand on an already established program that teaches self-discipline and responsibility to all students; provides a physical environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning; promotes communication and interaction in the classroom; supports an effective environment that promotes a sense of belonging and self esteem; and provides an academic environment that promotes learning and self-fulfillment.

The Alturas International Academy uses the Primary Years Program (PYP) designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) as a curriculum framework for young learners. Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to react, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment. Like all IB programs, PYP is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas. In the process, students develop critical thinking, research, self-management, communication, and social skills.

At Alturas, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six trans-disciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry are:

Who we are
Where we are in place and time
How we express ourselves
How the world works
How we organize ourselves
Sharing the planet

Units of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, information technology, science, and social studies, helping students make meaningful connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.

INQUIRY-BASED:
The Primary Years Program (PYP) is based on a commitment to inquiry-based teaching and the development of the whole child; socially, emotionally, and intellectually. A core belief is that children learn more effectively when they are actively involved in the learning process and build upon existing knowledge in real-life contexts – In other words, when learning is relevant and engaging.

MULTILINGUAL: 
Spanish is the language of instruction in our K–5 elementary school program.  We welcome students from all language backgrounds. Over 80% of our students begin with no Spanish language at home.

NURTURING ENVIRONMENT: 
Alturas' smaller class sizes ensure that the teachers and staff can focus on students’ social and emotional development in addition to their intellectual progress. From a place of safety, students are encouraged to inquire, wonder, and investigate—to lay the foundations of interculturally sensitive and inquisitive lives.

EXPERIENCED, CARING TEACHERS: 
Alturas' teachers provide opportunities for students to build meaning and refine understanding through structured inquiry. Outside the classroom, Alturas teachers are an integral part of our community.

REAL-WORLD CONNECTIONS: 
Students synthesize and showcase their learning by applying new knowledge to real-world problems and working collaboratively to find solutions.  For example, 5th-grade students work in groups to prepare an exhibition and presentation about a topic of their choice, showcasing their self-guided learning to the community.
