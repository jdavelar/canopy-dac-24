Vision: The vision of the AAL is founded on the notion that a Year 2025 workplace requires new skills and the ability to think critically. AAL prepares students for college and the modern workplace via personalized learning, allowing students to learn at a pace and modality that best fits his learning style and capitalizes on his strengths. AAL's instructional model integrates the following components: 1. LSAE Model. In this model, teachers deliver a lesson to all students for the first 20-30 minutes of class. They then sort students into four groups (Learning, Securing, Accelerating, Enriching) based on their demonstrated mastery of the skill. Depending on their needs, students receive small-group instruction or auxiliary lessons to extend or accelerate their learning, either via online learning or with a learning coach. 2. Student Learning Profiles and Plans. At the beginning of the school year, the school works with students and parents to develop a student learning profile, a document that includes students' past achievement data, strengths, areas for growth, and interests. Teachers are tasked with using the student learning profiles to develop student learning plans, customized strategies that are used to inform instruction of the student within the LSAE model. 3. Habits of Success and Learning How to Learn. The school has developed a set of ""Habits of Success"" that they hope to instill in students, including ""be at school and on time,"" ""strive for accuracy,"" ""respect for others,"" ""perseverance,"" etc. The school is also using a self-assessment rubric once a week to help students learn how to learn, measuring learning skills such as ""I choose the right learning environment,"" ""I am resourceful in finding assistance.""",

Multi-Classroom Leadership is the foundation of an Opportunity Culture; multi-classroom leaders (MCLs) lead a small teaching team, providing instructional guidance and frequent, on-the-job development, while continuing to teach part of the time. The schools redesign schedules to provide additional school-day time for teacher planning, coaching and collaboration. MCLs typically lead the introduction of more effective curricula, instructional methods, classroom management and schoolwide culture-building. Accountable for the results of all students in the team, multi-classroom leaders earn substantial pay supplements, within the regular school budget.

Teachers' primary roles have shifted from serving as the source of all knowledge to serving as academic coaches who help students determine their own, individual pathways to mastering the standards and guide them along the way. Students have gone from learning passively (or not learning at all) to taking full responsibility for their learning and ownership of their outcomes.  Students (1) use their assessment data to determine which standard to work on, (2) set a short-term goal to master the standard, (3) select the resources, activities and people they think will best help them reach mastery, and (4) use formative assessments to determine when move on.

They are very articulate on how they have worked with the staff to co-develop this model, across three cohorts of teachers. Colleen Collins gave us an important lesson from her work there as principal: ""everyone needs to feel that they're part of the pilot."" Meaning: initially the school worked deeply with its first cohort to co-develop the model, and then did the same with the second cohort; when it came time to bring the third cohort into the work, those teachers were told to watch the other cohorts and ""do what they do."" That strategy produced some pushback from those teachers and convinced Colleen and other school leaders that in fact, it is crucial in designing and implementing agency-driven learning models to make sure that the adults are all experiencing the same kind of agency-driven culture. Later cohorts of teachers can't simply be asked to implement; they must be invited to co-create as much as earlier cohorts, even as they also are able to build on the work of those cohorts. This is a crucial lesson for the field.

In doing so, they become self-initiating ""apprentice adults,"" developing and demonstrating high degrees of agency, persistence, problem-solving, resilience, creativity, and collaboration skills. Much of the learning at D-Tech is applied, inquiry-based learning (as in the High Tech High model). Visitors are often amazed to see how independently the students operate.

The school was designed by a team of teachers, who are the co-founders and current lead collaborators of the school. The objective was to create a school that serves a population that is representative of Greeley with demographics to match that of the community. The current student population is 50.8 % white and 49.1% Hispanic or multiple races, with 49% of the population receiving free or reduced lunch. Designed based on the belief that children are naturally curious and creative learners, the school's mission is to foster an atmosphere that encourages risk-taking and curiosity so that students are empowered to become problem-finders and problem-solvers. One of the hallmarks of FTSOI is the fidelity to its design foundations (mission, instructional vision, core values, and design priorities). The design foundations are not just a series of statements, but rather serve as the foundation for decisions and structures throughout the school and are evident in their daily practice. This leads to a school that iterates on the execution of this design, but still maintains a strong identity grounded in its founding principles. Students explore theme-based topics (loops), with cross-content connections that ask them to learn about topics and concepts in greater depth, in grade level bands. Ingrained in the heart of the school's culture is openness to failure and trying again. The goal is to make failure feel safe so that students aren't afraid to try new things. Additionally, teacher and leadership roles have been reimagined at this school. Teachers are known as Band Collaborators and generally teach two grade levels of students within their band. School leadership responsibilities are distributed among three educators who are both Band Collaborators and Lead Collaborators.",

Brooks is one of 11 schools in Chicago Public Schools participating in Illinois' competency-based education pilot program. In competency-based learning, educators assess and advance students based on demonstrated mastery of specific skills, abilities, and knowledge.       

Brooks Principal Shannae Jackson and her staff created rubrics detailing the learning standards and what mastery of each standard looks like. The rubrics express clear expectations for each performance or project, which helps students self-assess their path forward for improving and/or progressing to the next unit. Students can work at their own pace without feeling left behind or waiting for the rest of the class. Students receive scores on a scale of 0 to 4. A 4 reflects exceeding mastery of the standard, a three reflects mastery, a 2 reflects a minor conceptual error, a 1 reflects a major conceptual error, and a 0 reflects no attempt at the standard or an attempt unrelated to the content. Students receive letter grades based on the percentage of standards met.      

""Students are starting to talk about needing to demonstrate mastery,"" said Principal Jackson. ""They'll say, 'This is exactly what I need to do. This is exactly the learning target or standard I have not demonstrated mastery in so I need to do more practice work or go into tutoring.' They can articulate those things clearly. You can hear the language change in the hallways. They're like, 'I'm going in for the retake for the formative. Have you reached mastery yet?'

With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Holmes Central to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.

Notwithstanding Holmes Central's significant challenges, it serves as the lone high school for Holmes County, the poorest of Mississippi's 82 counties. The blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.

With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Madison Palmer HS to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.

Notwithstanding the school's significant challenges, Quitman County, where the school is located, is among the poorest counties in Mississippi. The blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.

Her idea was to take the most important and valuable elements from each approach and integrate them to create a new model. Our view is that she and her team have been able to do exactly that.  Too often, educators and reformers see only a narrow set of pedagogical approaches supporting a commitment to high achievement on standards-based metrics. Montessori for All is attempting to demonstrate that you can generate high achievement on state-generated standards through approaches that are more whole-child oriented. The schools is very obviously a Montessori school, first and foremost. But unlike most Montessori schools, this one has mapped high-expectation standards against and within Montessorian approaches and is supporting the work with various forms of enabling technology.   Montessori has long been understood to be a model that does an excellent job of preparing children in holistic ways. It is faulted, sometimes, for falling short in enabling its students to demonstrate high achievement across traditional curriculum areas.

PMHS is noted for their transformation from a traditional learning environment to a student-centered learning environment. Innovations of note include: Site Council, Extended Learning Opportunities and Learning Studios.  The Site Council at PMHS is the main governing body of the school and is comprised of a majority of student representatives. The Site Council structure ensures student voice and leadership in the school's decision-making process. Site Council has taken on a number of issues over the years, including: making recommendations to the school board on revisions to the school handbook such as an open campus policy for students meeting a required percentage of competencies; developing and approving a flexible schedule that better accommodates competency-based learning and builds in time for faculty common planning time; as well as developing and approving rich learning opportunities such as Extended Learning Opportunities and Learning Studios.  Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs) and Learning Studios are both inquiry-based learning opportunities that allow students to apply and connect skills from content-area courses with their own personal interests and passions. Both opportunities include partnerships with the community. As the programs have evolved, many students who have completed ELOs now co-chair Learning Studios with faculty members on the same topics.

168,Reiche Community School,Portland,Maine,Portland Public Schools,"Center for Teaching Quality (CTQ), Education Evolving","Reiche Community School is the first teacher-powered school in Maine and serves a very diverse student population, many of whom qualify for free or reduced price lunch. They worked closely with their local association to transition to a teacher-powered model in order to better serve students.

Reiche is located near a large refugee processing and over 40% of their students are ESL, and of those over 40% are IELD. Reiche has over 40 languages spoken at their school and a high rate of poverty with 78% FRL.   Reiche was Maine's first ""failing"" school. A progressive principal assigned to the school built leadership capacity and a highly collaborative culture among the staff. When the principal was reassigned, the Reiche teacher team worked with their union local to negotiate with their superintendent to assign an interim principal while they entered a year of exploration.   The team voted to convert to teacher-powered in 2011, something collaborative teams across the nation are beginning to explore. Today, the team selects three lead teachers on a rotating basis (each lead teacher serving four years) and every teacher participates in school-level decision-making.  With interest in opening the opportunity for other groups of teachers to replicate Reiche's model, the Maine legislature in 2013 passed, ""An Act to Develop a Grant Program to Establish a Teacher-led School Model."" This Bill encourages teacher-powered schools by allowing schools or districts to apply for grant monies to explore, develop and implement alternative governance structures.  Under the teacher team's leadership, they have turned around their status as Maine's first failing school and are now a model for success. Reiche has found that if students stay at their school over 3 years (mobility is certainly an issue with their population) then proficiency rates start to dramatically rise.  The teacher team has decided to use a community school model to serve the many needs of their students and families. This means that they partner with local organizations to provide services to their students and families, for example, the Opportunity Alliance in Portland which provides children and adults with mental health services.

With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Scott Central to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.  In addition to these unique human resources, the blended model also provides students the opportunity to participate in intensive, residential preparatory programs throughout the year at local MS-based universities including the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University.    The Global Teaching Project is excited to nominate Scott Central HS because of the tremendous efforts it is undertaking to provide historically underserved students access to AP courses.  Notwithstanding Scott Central's significant challenges, the blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.

Staff and students who became sick while at school often could not be seen by a healthcare provider immediately, if at all. Beginning in 2018, Shawnee Public Schools partnered with the Team Clinics program to overcome these obstacles. With this partnership, Shawnee students and staff with health issues may go to the nurse's office and have a virtual doctor visit. In these virtual visits, the nurse connects online with a provider and, with special computer-connected equipment, the provider can check ears, noses, throats, lung sounds, and heartbeats. Often times, the patient receives a diagnosis and is treated within an hour or less. If the patient requires medication, the provider calls it into the pharmacy of the parent's choice.  Since the Team Clinic program began in September 2018, more than 110 students and staff have visited the virtual clinics. In that time, only one student and five teachers have been sent home due to illness.

The school implements a student-centered approach aligned to Farmington's improvement design. Curriculum, instruction, programming, and assessment are aligned to purpose-driven, socially-constructed, mastery-based and self-directed learning. One specific example to share is FLEX time. FLEX time is a challenge and support block developed by WWUES teachers. FLEX time provides students with a menu of options to select from that are both teacher and student directed. Choice is a key element of the design and student-engaged assessment practices drive a self-directed model of challenge and support within this innovative model. Two years after this teacher-led innovation was developed, Farmington is implementing this design across K-8 schools. Clear standards and data driven decision-making are a key feature of WWUES' student-centered approach. All standards for the week are clearly articulated and the student work from the week provides the body of evidence that demonstrates student progress towards those standards. While many of the offerings are based on academic standards, they are not exclusively so. Sessions can focus on learner mindset, Vision of the Graduate skills, organization, or any other social/emotional or executive functioning skills that teachers identify as an area of need. Student self-reflection, voice and choice is key to this daily block. Students are given tools and feedback to assess their own strengths and needs and are trusted to make wise choices about how to most effectively make use of the time and support they are provided. Students who have met the standards are given the opportunity to exceed the standard by working on the standard at a more advanced level. WWUES implements a mastery-based approach to empower students as leaders of their own learning. Farmington's mastery-based principles are implemented in all classrooms. ",
225,Wheeling High School,Wheeling,Illinois,Township District 214,Illinois State Board of Education,"Dr. Lazaro Lopez, then principal of Wheeling High School, met with manufacturers, business leaders and the local department of economic development in 2007 to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region needed to meet workforce demand. That partnership gave birth to the Township High School District 214 Career Pathways program. District 214 prepares its students for college and careers through experiential learning in 16 career clusters and 44 career pathways. The Career Pathways program currently serves more than 12,000 students from six comprehensive high schools, including Wheeling High School, and four specialized learning programs. District 214 purposefully eliminated the distinction between core courses and technical and career education courses. As many as 85 percent of District 214's students graduate having taken a college course, and two-thirds have completed nine semester hours of college credit by the time they graduate, an opportunity for considerable savings in tuition costs. Ninety-five percent of the district's students identify a career area of interest by graduation. Students have logged more than 2 million hours of workplace learning. The Educator Prep career pathway has served as a statewide model for addressing the teacher shortage. The teaching cluster begins with a sequence of high school courses that provide students an early feel for education as a career. Students who continue with the program earn early college credits and spend several days a week teaching lessons in actual K-12 classrooms under the close supervision of a master teacher. Students then can continue in the Educator Prep program with a postsecondary partner and earn a bachelor's degree and a teaching license. The district provides a network of supports for students while in college to increase the likelihood they graduate and become teachers. The district guarantees each student first access to interview for district teaching jobs. ",

Each project is 4-6 weeks in length. Freshmen have a more structured schedule, and educators work to help them acclimate to the project-based work to come. As a student approaches graduation, he or she will spend time off-campus in an internship or engaged in college classes. Students also design their own Capstone Projects. Projects integrate fieldwork, guest experts, and authentic audiences that help bring curriculum to life. The hands-on nature of the school's approach reflects a workplace environment that will prepare students for the future.
