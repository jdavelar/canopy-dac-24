This year, I have leaned heavily on my teams and small teams can be the catalyst needed to make the systemic changes in education.  Another example is our equity work.  We brought together teachers, predominantly white, from all of our schools to identify their biases so we can take it down to our kids.  As you mentioned, give the schools the problem to solve and give them the flexibility to meet the goal.      I oversee both KBMS and GBMS but only filled out one survey.

The HLHS staff created an online portal/Zoom event, in which community members/families/HLHS staff were able to virtually participate in student exhibitions and celebrations of learning. In addition, HLHS continued student internship and practicum placements. Students participated virtually at various agencies and medical clinics throughout Albuquerque as well as Care Calls to support Aging and Long Term services to set up COVID Vaccines for our elderly community.
