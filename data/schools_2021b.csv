As Janet would describe, they are like the super highway to graduation because they offer the tools and capacity for students to choose their path and pace to graduation. Their student body is made up of students from different ethnic, socio-economic, and academic levels, yet each receives a personalized program to fit their needs. For example, traditionally homeschooled students may choose to enroll with OVA because they still have control over their learning with support from certified teachers. Students who want more rigor than the traditional school enroll to move ahead faster. The school has partnerships with foster care and court programs where they provide the path for those students to continue their education. One student may take courses from three different vendors while another is taking two online courses, two college courses, an art course at a local community partner, and getting credit for a job through a work-based program.   I am always amazed at the perseverance and commitment they have for each individual student.

Link Learning partners with brick and mortar schools that have exhausted their options for students who need a personalized learning plan and individual support.

Students take just one or two courses at a time. Even though Link Learning is a virtual school, they have learning centers around the state for students to come and learn in a welcoming, supportive environment. Their partnership with the brick and mortar schools also allow their students to take seated courses.   Link Learning uses a tool to manage student engagement and progress. The program was developed in partnership with a software development company and their district, including virtual teachers. It automatically collects data from their LMS and records their staff interactions to get a whole-child view of each student. Within this system, they have the ability to see where a student falls in MTSS so they can intervene more quickly. The data is reviewed daily by teachers, weekly by learning center directors, and monthly by the quality assurance team (who support staff professional learning). Their data shows that the more intentional the teacher-student conversations, the more students are engaged, and the greater their academic achievement. These intentional conversations focus on helping students understand their role in learning, making a plan to fit education into their lives, and reflecting on their progress.   There is also a heavy focus on social-emotional learning. The school has staff specifically assigned to EL students, 13 special education staff, and social workers who work with students and staff. Relationships are built between students, staff, and parents to develop a community where they all feel they belong. Professional learning for staff includes shifting mindsets. First, they must understand that getting at-risk students to enroll is a success in itself. Once enrolled, they need to create connections and relationships so they are taught how to talk and relate to students. After relationships are built and students start engaging, they can focus conversations on learning such as time on task, number of days in class, and what they did when they were successful. The staff also works with students to help them self-regulate with the goal for them to become effective members of society.

When the school first opened, neighboring districts did not want the school there, but are now sending students to WMVA who need a more personalized approach that they cannot offer. Probation officers and juvenile homes also refer youth to their school. Now in their 11th year, WMVA is averaging 50 graduates a year. Based on graduate surveys, the school has found that 53% felt strongly they would probably not have graduated if they attended a traditional high school, but after attending WMVA, 80% had a plan for what they wanted to accomplish after graduation.  WMVA was the first virtual school in the state to hire a full-time social worker. The social worker helps students, many of them at-risk, manage life skills as well as their academic success. Their students suffer from social or school anxiety, panic attacks, abuse (emotional, physical or sexual), bullying (both virtual and physical), LGBTQ issues, and depression. The school also serves students with oppositional defiance disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourettes, and others that may make it challenging to attend a traditional school. Through the work of the social worker, WMVA is able to assist students in reducing or removing barriers so they can successfully complete their education. To accomplish this, the social worker works with teachers to provide training around students’ social and emotional needs. Staff is also going through anti-racism training. Even though they are a virtual school, WMVA provides food for the students that come to the drop-in center through a partnership with the Southwest Michigan Food Bank.

The model focuses on personalized learning and direct instruction with a focus on meeting more than solely academic needs.   Personalized learning is an approach to instruction that is centered on the student. It taps into a student’s needs, strengths, and interests to engage students and to provide a “best fit” education for each student. The instruction is tailored to the individual needs of the student, and students learn in a way that best meets their learning style. Third Future's personalized learning program features four distinguishing characteristics: 1. Learner Profile is a summary of the student’s academic history, strengths, interests, social-emotional needs, and how he learns best. It is developed with the student and the parents in order to let the school know how to provide a tailored education that meets the individual student’s needs and goals. 2. Student Learning Plan is the individualized, academic plan that will enable the student to reach academic proficiency and meet his other learning goals. It outlines the part of a student’s curriculum that will be taught directly and the activities and lessons that will be customized for the student. 3. Flexible Learning Environment allows students to have a more tailored schedule and allows the teacher to use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction. Students may receive some instruction in a large group (25 students) or work in a small group, with a partner, or by himself. With the help of technology, and because the doors of the school will be open from 6:30 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., students may also learn before school, after school, or at home. 4. Competency-Based Education allows students to learn at their own pace. If a student has already mastered an objective or standard, they can move on to accelerated objectives or to a topic related to their other learning goals. If a student is struggling with a particular concept, she can take more time and received more individualized or small group instruction.   Third Future is also implements the ""dyad"" concept that establishes requirements for experiences that are often only available to students with means, such as participating in sports, learning an instrument, traveling, and more. Third Future provides these experiences to students who are not able to afford them.   Students in the upper grades at Sam Houston also take a course called The Art of Thinking. To my knowledge, Third Future Schools spend the most time on teaching critical thinking and informational literacy, which is so critical to our current society.   Finally, Sam Houston is currently open from 6:30-4:30 (and even later outside of the current pandemic), which provides families free before and after school care.

Administration, staff, and volunteers have been working tirelessly to launch the k-5 public charter school. When they realized COVID-19 was going to monumentally shift education models, they pivoted and created their COVID response plan. I3 Academy teammates consulted with local Department of Health and CDC leaders to create the i3 Safe for Me COVID-19 Response plan. The tenants of the plan include increased hygiene and social distancing measures, extreme flexibility of learning, and strong communication between the school and families. We are a couple of months into school, and our model is working. Students have adapted to wearing their face covering in-person and remote learning when not on campus. Our teachers have integrated synchronous learning with unique ideas like a remote field trip to her family’s farm and virtual letter hunts. As part of our COVID safety plan, families had the choice to decide the learning format that best serves their students. We have students fully in-person, fully remote, and hybrid with two days on campus and remote the rest of the week. None of the schools in our area offered that many learning formats or allowed families’ input.   I3 Academy is built on the belief that all children can succeed in school when they are engaged in learning. The teaching model focuses on educating the whole child. Classroom teachers embed social-emotional learning into all lessons. Students, their teacher, and paraeducator meet each morning to walk through a social-emotional curriculum that emphasizes empathy, self-regulation, and other interpersonal skills. I3 Academy also has a social worker, school counselor, and community liaison on staff who ensure students are receiving the wraparound services needed to excel in the classroom. The Student Support Services team has built partnerships with various local non-profits ranging from Christ Health Center, a nearby health clinic that agrees to see i3 Academy students at low cost, to Christian Service Mission, which provided 250 Thanksgiving boxes.   I3 Academy is a diverse school with over 91% students of color. I3 Academy leadership intentionally recruited a diverse set of educators and staff. Over 55% of staff are people of color and nearly 20% of the on-campus staff are male. All staff underwent anti-racism training to begin the school year, and those conversations are on-going in the classroom and throughout the school.

Families were given a choice of learning format that best suited their needs and COVID-19 comfortability. Since school began, we have offered three learning format changes so far. With each learning format change, we work to reorganize staffing, furniture, and instruction to meet the community’s needs. Teachers and paraeducators have demonstrated extreme flexibility in their educational approaches during this time. One teacher took students along on a trip to her family’s farm--many of our urban students had never seen that number of farm animals! Students lived out the mission of solving problems they see in the world by solving Halloween during COVID-19. Their solution was a STEAM-inspired, socially-distanced “Maskoween: Trick or Treat and Stay Back 6 Feet”.  We have two school nurses on staff, and they have led our focus on informed science to make i3 Academy as safe as possible. They’ve built a relationship with a local pediatric urgent care for bi-weekly COVID testing for all staff. If a staff member or student tests positive for COVID, we’ve developed a strong protocol to ensure all families are notified and ready for the immediate switch to remote learning.

Real world skills training - the school prepares all students by providing each with a laptop of their own, certifications in all Microsoft Office applications, and financial literacy training in each year 3.

Mendez operated as a community school long before it became one of the first members of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Community School cohort in 2019. This means that the school prioritizes the four pillars of a community school: integrated student supports (wraparound services), extended learning time and opportunity, distributed leadership, and family and community engagement. Students understand that their wellbeing is at the heart of the school's mission. In 2019, 85% of students reported feeling safe at Mendez and 81% of students reported that they are happy to be at Mendez (LAUSD School Experience Survey, 2019). At Mendez, student learning is also a priority, and the school’s graduation rates have risen dramatically in the ten years since its founding in 2009. The school began with a graduation rate of nearly 50% and now has a graduation rate of over 84%, 90% of whom go to college.  As part of the school's focus on integrated student supports, Mendez High School partners with a number of different community organizations that provide services to students and their families. These community partners fulfill different roles on campus and can engage in case management, put on whole-school events, and offer group supports. Individual case management organizations, like Promesa Boyle Heights or Communities in Schools LA, provide one-on-one supports to students and families, often targeting dropout prevention and academic engagement through mental health supports or other interventions. The school also recently broke ground on a Wellness Center, where it will be able to provide mental and physical health resources to the Boyle Heights community. This Wellness Center is the result of over 10 years of organizing by the school and its community partners.   The school also holds high academic expectations for its students and launched two initiatives that target student learning gains: AP for All and Computer Science for All. As part of these initiatives, all Mendez students take at least one AP course and at least one Computer Science course prior to graduation. Many students choose to continue taking AP and Computer Science courses once they are exposed to the experience. Teachers and parents were concerned at the outset of the AP for All initiative that students would all choose to take AP Spanish, as the student population is predominantly Latino/a/x and there is a higher proportion of English Learners at Mendez than there are across the district and statewide. And yet, students have demonstrated an interest in a variety of AP courses since the initiative began. The school also focuses on the needs of students with disabilities and uses an inclusion model to ensure that students with special needs are given the same opportunities to learn as their peers.   Mendez's principal, Mauro Bautista, models a culture of distributed leadership. This is reflected in many of the aspects of the school, including its multiple governing bodies that include a variety of stakeholders throughout the community. There is a School Site Council, Local School Leadership, the School Culture Committee, the Family Action Team, and the House of Student Representatives. Many of the initiatives that are currently central to Mendez’s approach are the result Principal Bautista seeking feedback from educators and families to guide decisions, including the school’s Restorative Justice, Computer Science for All, and AP for All initiatives, which were all started by Mendez teachers.  The school has a hands-on approach to family and community engagement, which it leveraged when the pandemic closed LAUSD schools. Mendez staff and community partners reached out to every student and family, and if they could not contact anyone they did home visits. At these home visits, they provided an array of services, including delivering food or supplies and providing mental health check-ins. They also leveraged these relationships with families to determine how to deliver instruction in the Fall of 2020. Teachers, families, and students came together over the summer to determine the master schedule in the fall. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. They began planning for hybrid learning, where students will be on-campus part-time and their instruction will be aligned across the virtual and in-person learning environments.  Being on Mendez's campus is a joyful experience. Students whom you speak with readily share their learning, parents are frequently on campus volunteering or taking classes at its Family Center, and school leaders like Principal Bautista are often wandering the halls or working in the library because they both want to be accessible to the community and because they probably gave their office away to a community partner who is visiting campus. I'm excited to nominate Mendez because it is truly a community-based initiative that puts social and racial justice at the center of its decisions, which are all in service of the bright future of its students.","blended learning,designing for equity,culture of anti-racist action,project-based learning,social-emotional learning & school culture","community schools, family engagement/empowerment",Yes,"When schools shuttered in March, Mendez staff began tracking who wasn’t logging into classes and to reached out to them over email, phone, and any other means possible. If they could not reach a student or family, they organized a home visit to understand what was going on. In addition to tech issues, they found that their families were often struggling with food insecurity or needed basic necessities like toilet paper. They engaged their community partners to provide these resources, and required all families to pick up devices, hot spots, and even furniture from the school to ensure students are set up to be successful in their virtual learning.  The school has also engaged family, student, and teacher feedback to determine the schedule for the Fall and Spring, including family and extracurricular programming. Mendez created a subcommittee that was open to members of the school community to help determine what the schedule would look like in the Fall during online learning. They chose a quarter system so that students could focus more deeply on fewer classes and so that teachers would have half of their typical caseload. Because they began planning so early and brought in so many stakeholders, they had their schedule ready prior to the district and there was a groundswell of support for the schedule that they chose. This allowed Mendez to apply for a waiver to run this community-determined schedule in the Fall. Many of the student clubs, although none of the sports teams, still meet virtually and partners provide case management through a video platform or on the phone.   Community partners continue to meet as a team facilitated by the school's Community School Coordinator biweekly, where they track which students are or are not engaging so that they can deliver individual supports when students are beginning not to show up. After speaking with students and families, they learned that most students were using the family device during the mornings, when they had originally planned to provide family-based classes and activities so they now run this programming at 6pm, including a weekly Zumba class.

Vermont's regional technical centers serve students from multiple school districts. As the high schools in the CTE centers' service regions adopted proficiency based graduation requirements, CTE centers quickly discovered that the learning students did in their CTE programs of study were recognized and transcripted differently at each sending high school. For example, for students in an electrical technology program, some high schools applied the students' CTE learning toward science proficiency requirements, some toward math proficiency requirements, some only to transferable skills proficiency requirements, and others to all three. As a result, students who were working side-by-side in classrooms, labs, and shops, mastering the same technical content, were facing inequities in how their CTE learning did or did not support their work toward high school graduation.   Central Vermont Career Center (CVCC)saw these inequities at play and spent three years working to address and overcome them. They began by aligning their CTE program curricula to the Vermont Agency of Education's Sample Graduation Proficiencies. Their STEM Coordinator worked with each CTE program to identify the math and science content in the curriculum, including industry recognized credentials, dual enrollment courses, and state licensure exams, and cross-walk them to proficiency based graduation requirements. The Center's Literacy Coordinator did the alignment to English Language Arts/Literacy proficiencies. At the same time, Central Vermont Career Center's administrators dedicated significant staff professional development time to support this work. For the first two years, CVCC contracted with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring in a CTE math specialist who worked with teachers to assess their math instruction and to bring added rigor to their math lessons. During the third year of this process, CVCC partnered with the Vermont State College system to offer a 2 credit course for faculty to develop shared practices and resources for integrating literacy in all CTE program curricula, again aligned to the state's sample proficiency based graduation requirements.   At the same time, CVCC assessed all students' math, reading, and writing skills at the beginning and end of each school year and analyzed data at both the program and center-wide levels.   This cumulative body of work was shared with the Barre Unified Union School District's Curriculum Director, who in turn held a series of meetings with her colleagues in the six supervisory unions/school districts that send students to CVCC. At the end of that process, and after three years of scaffolded, deliberate work, all six sending high schools agreed on a matrix that identifies proficiency base graduation requirements by CTE program area, ensuring that every student in a given program will have their sending high school transcript their CTE learning in the same way and document their meeting of proficiency based graduation requirements through successful CTE program completion.

Along with all other schools in Vermont in compliance with Act 77, FWSU is also moving forward with a proficiency-based curriculum model that emphasizes essential academic concepts, content, and skills, including Transferable Skills, to help ensure our students are college and career-ready.? ?   The connections among the national standards, local curriculum, and classroom instruction and assessment play a critical role in an integrated design of engaging and relevant learning opportunities for students. Educators believe an integrated approach is the “best fit’’ for meeting targets. Project-based learning (PjBL) is one strategy used for integrating content. Although there are currently PjBL “islands of excellence” in science and world language, implementing this approach holds the potential for growth in the future.   Proficiency-driven opportunities highlight learning that?is?personalized and learning environments that are flexible. FWSU’s goal is to ensure that their students receive a “future-ready, world-class education” and graduate with the knowledge and skills to successfully pursue their goals.    Bellows Free Academy (BFA), the supervisory union high school, has been leading this work and providing guidance for the elementary schools. Outcome proficiencies cut across all four years of high schools with performance indicators being used to determine proficiency. Educators are refining common assessments and provide different pathways for students to achieve expected outcomes. The principal of BFA is a master at developing a schedule with blocks of varying amounts of time to create a learning environment that is responsive to the needs of learners. There is a comprehensive approach to supporting students. Educators know their students deeply and create a culture that is connected and authentic.   Performance assessments in grades eight and ten prepare students for a capstone project in twelfth grade. There are also pathways to distinction that are available which are personalized according to a student’s interest. This opportunity “ignites a fire” for some students.  BFA administrators and staff have been engaged in learning and having conversations about equity for several years. Last spring, while on dismissal, racial justice became a  part of their student’s world. School had ended for the summer, but leadership knew they couldn’t wait for the fall to connect with students about this important issue. A group of teachers decided to put out an open invitation to have a discussion about what was going on in the world and how to move forward together. Around a dozen students joined the first zoom session. They asked questions about the return to school and other topics before the conversation shifted to equity and racial justice in their school. At first, the teachers facilitated the conversation, but somewhere in the middle of the summer, the students took over the agenda and the conversation. Their goal was to provide opportunities for the student body to join the conversation about racial justice in their school and in the world, and ultimately improve the culture of BFA. Thus, the Fairfax Racial Justice  Alliance (RJA) began. Since the start of the school year, students have been exposed to the four agreements and the compass from Courageous Conversations. They have had discussions about equity using case studies that explore socio-economic, cultural and racial bias, and equity. Work in advisory complements the goals of the BFA Fairfax  RJA.   Additionally, an early warning system approach is in place to examine if certain students are being marginalized. Educators recognize the importance of confronting evidence about which students are historically privileged, and which are not. This process is strengthening practices to support all learners. Both the student and the system levels are being analyzed to determine where inequities exist and how to implement change.

Some of the positives outcomes that have been identified by educators include instructional staff who are laser-focused on the most powerful instructional concepts and skills, and interventions are in place for individual students who are moving forward with core instruction by providing for individual learning needs. Teachers across the supervisory union have commented that “virtual” parent communications are a new practice that is creating more family engagement in the educational process.

They have fully embraced project-based learning and the five stages of finding a solution, real-time collaboration, and a flexible schedule to match their learning environments’ flexibility.   Eden Park Learning Community is an ensemble of student-centered collaborative spaces. Moving away from the one teacher, one room, and sole care of one group of students, it is an environment that supports learner-agency, transparent technology, and fosters a wide variety of teaching and learning situations. These situations range from small group and independent study to whole group instruction or one-on-one with a teacher. The spaces also emphasize the importance of teacher collaboration by deprivatizing the planning process and include workspaces that allow teachers to work both independently and collaboratively.  The adoption of the Learning Community model at Eden Park has brought more flexibility and variety in day-to-day learning activities.  The old corridor was absorbed into the Learning Commons, leading to an agile space that supports multiple ways of learning, and multiple groups of learners.  This type of shared commons created a diffuse distribution of students and collaborative work areas.  Transparency between Learning Studios and the Commons facilitates interdisciplinary PBL learning for kids, adults, and folks who push-into these spaces for special services. The teachers have embraced industry experts and community partnerships in every way. Industry partners now plan with teachers, launch projects, and are utilized for feedback throughout each stage in the problem-solving process.   Teacher professional development through FI is embedded into the fabric of their work. Cranston is involved in ongoing professional development, which includes a three-year teacher coaching program. Teachers develop mastery in a collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum. Each year, the program becomes more student-centered, with learners identifying and defining problems and projects themselves by year three.   The results are in: at the 3rd-5th Grade Learning Community at the Eden Park School, the first completed, the level of engagement, personalization and physical comfort has reduced absences, seen a huge drop in disciplinary issues, and all but eliminated the need for specialized isolation and decompression rooms for students with special needs--instead, they are thriving within a suite of spaces shared by everyone in their learning community. The result is more learning, more joy, and less space required. ","blended learning,expanded measures of success,project-based learning,social-emotional learning & school culture","The Eden Park project proves that when a school is designed for the whole student at every level, it will prepare them and their teachers for the 21st century and show them a new vision of the future through the joy of learning.  In March, when schools shut down for Covid-19, Eden Park Elementary found their students in a Fielding International designed Learning Community space, successfully set up their at-home learning environments. Their teachers found they could work more independently than the students who were not in learning environments that provided the freedom and agency for learners to independently appropriate the types of spaces based on the kind of learning and thinking they were engaging in.

Faculty meet regularly in small groups to discuss current equity issues in the school and wider community, explore solutions, examine implicit bias, and to research and develop different curricular and pedagogical resources. These PLC groups provide a means through which to foster a culture of continuous equity learning amongst faculty, as well as a space to process personal experiences with inequity and bias. As part of RU's regularly scheduled professional development, the PLC structure is supporting faculty in developing equity as a lens through which to approach teaching and learning.  As part of this ongoing professional development, RU developed a set of social justice standards adapted from those published by Teaching Tolerance, called the Democratic Engagement Standards. These standards provide a structure through which teachers can design learning experiences that ask students to grapple with issues related to identity, equity, and structural injustice. RU is currently in the pilot year of using these standards, working towards identifying places in the curriculum that already provide opportunities to address these topics, in addition to places where these standards and topics could be further developed. As the Democratic Engagement Standards are not content-area specific, and can be integrated into any subject area, RU is actively working towards incorporating this essential work in classes beyond just the humanities.  The equity-focused PLC program also works to foster a culture of anti-racist action, encouraging teachers to collaboratively address systemic inequities in the school building. Student activism is encouraged and supported through project-based learning opportunities. Students organized and hosted the first ever state-wide student conference on racial justice in the Spring of 2019, bringing together students and activists from across Vermont.

This effort allowed students, parents, educators, and community members in the newly formed Windsor Central Modified Unified Union District to collectively construct a vision of their graduates and a plan for enabling learners to meet those expectations. The strategic plan that was developed provides a clear roadmap with the Portrait of a Graduate being their “north star.” Leadership recognized the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in a meaningful process to achieve positive change. I was fortunate to be able to attend sessions and observe the high-level of commitment by all involved.   A systems perspective is also evident in Windsor Central’s strategic plan through intentional connections between strategies and the Portrait of a Graduate competencies. For instance, Strategy 1.2 states, “Achieve a high level of math proficiency for all students through curriculum review, classroom instructional practices, professional development, and robust interventions so that all students reach their full potential.” The related Portrait Competency, Academic Excellence, is identified in order to ensure coherence between strategies and competencies.   At the classroom level, the Portrait of a Graduate (PoG) is driving K-12 deeper learning. A variety of modes, such as project-based learning, are used to enable students to meet the competencies described within the Portrait. The focus on deeper learning within project-based learning is a clear motivator for educators. A deeper learning group created a booklet to support high-quality projects. This “Teacher’s Toolkit” is aimed at providing strategies for fostering skills and dispositions within the PoG. It was developed by educators as a resource to bring the PoG to life in classrooms. The three strategies include:  1.	Increasing student voice and choice in our classrooms;  2.	Infusing learning with robust routines of critique, revision, and reflection; and 3.	Creating public products for authentic audiences.  Additionally, professional learning opportunities designed by educators were provided for classroom teachers. The intent was to provide a collaborative space for deeper learning and design in the spring that would enable participants to plan for the new school year and build capacity within schools. The foundational goals included:  ?	Create a culture of “Deep Learning” in tone, vibe, excitement across age groups; ?	Foster collaboration between participants across grade levels; ?	Understand that Deep Learning is a RESULT of teacher choices; ?	Connect Deep learning to the PoG; ?	Develop a list of “instructional lenses”;  ?	Reflect on current practice: How am I already promoting the PoG; and  ?	Develop a sense of remote AND deep learning.   A collaborative effort between the Marsh Billings National Historic Park, the Upper Valley Teaching Place Collaborative, and Windsor Central has resulted in opportunities for place-based education with the goal of connecting students to place, culture and social-historical connections to place. One project has been focused on Naturalist Backpacks. Naturalist Backpacks’ tools allow children to take a close look at the world around them. Place-based learning supports the development of a sense of wonder, grows students’ social-emotional skills, increases engagement, and builds a better understanding of the world.   Windsor Central Unified Union School District has engaged in racial equity work with the support of Writing Wrongs, LLC. The Windsor Central School Board’s anti-racist work is focused on creating anti-racist policy. They have received a grant to dig further into current anti-racist efforts, starting with school board members and leadership within the system. An equity audit will be used to gather data regarding the current status.   The Leadership Team commits to adopting a more visible stance of active listening, collective learning, internal reflection, and critical evaluation of current practice. This stance and any action plans will be developed with the help of partnerships with individuals and organizations centered on this work to expose systemic racism embedded in our educational system. Leadership commits to providing students with an education that is explicitly anti-racist and refuses to turn away from the hard truths of our history.

Teachers have moved to use Google Classroom as the primary interface with students. The Batesville School District has allowed students to choose between 3 different learning environments this school year, based on the parent and student preference. Most of our students are in person or remote, which for BJHS means the student is joining a physical classroom via Google Meet from an alternate location. This allows the student to take part in classroom discussions and have access ""real-time"" to a teacher but doing so from the safety of their location of choice.  As far as doing things differently, BJHS is a one to one school. All students are issued a Chromebook, and the vast majority of our curriculum is provided via a digital format. Because BJHS had chosen to go one to one a few years ago, the staff and students were already in a situation to pivot to off-site learning when COVID struck our area. Though there were issues to resolve, our district was in a strong position to roll out digital learning to students. When this school year began, all students were given 3 options regarding how they would receive their education. Students were given the option of attending in person, attend ""remotely"" (which is described above), or attending virtually.   Virtual instruction at BJHS consisted of students accessing courseware via Edgenuity or Lincoln Learning and working at their own pace.

All members of the MVU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (DEI) Committee have a solid understanding of the principles and practices of equity literacy in education.  Educators from Swanton and Sheldon were intensively introduced to these principles and practices.  At MVU, several members of the DEI Committee feel fully prepared to plan and offer equity literacy professional learning to the staff. Additionally, an equity student survey was created, and feedback provided by the Equity Literacy Institute.  Educators secured funding to get the results of the survey professionally analyzed through an equity lens.   MVU has met the expectation of Proficiency-Based Learning with a thoughtful transition.  Early work was done 7 years ago to prioritize standards and create clear learning expectations, learning scales for common summative assessments, and school-wide habits of work.  Over the past 4 years, educators have implemented a more refined version of proficiency-based learning which includes a transition to proficiency-based grades, personalized course offerings, and robust and flexible ‘keeping up and catching up’ interventions.  As a highlight, the English Language Arts department has wholeheartedly embraced independent reading.  Students now meet their reading proficiencies by providing evidence from books that they choose.  Over the past 5 years, MVU has intentionally designed programming and interventions that prioritize students who struggle academically so that all students achieve at high levels.  Most recently, educators have invested in learning about the Equity Literacy model in order to ensure that they address the needs of historically marginalized students.  This work began with a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which started as a group of committed and passionate teachers and has grown to impact and influence the broader school community and district.  The committee pursued grant funding to acquire training to become Equity Literacy trainers and bring the Equity Literacy model to the entire faculty. In the process, the high school committee formed partnerships with two local elementary schools and the Abenaki community. Though COVID has delayed training the rest of faculty in Equity Literacy, the DEI Committee has been busy at work to bring their Equity Literacy lens to the culture and operations of the school. Recent Work: •	Facilitate and support a student DEI group. •	Collaborate with the Pride Alliance and National Arts Honor Society to have students paint a rainbow crosswalk at the school entrance. •	Provide resource guides to teachers to help students process racial unrest in April and the election in November. Current Work: •	Reviewing the Social Awareness portion of the MVSD SEL Competency Guide to recommend strategies that are equity minded and promote equity. •	Collaborating with students to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of the schoolwide routine. •	Supporting students in their efforts to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at school. Work that is being planning: •	Administering an Equity survey to students and then analyzing the data. •	Begin Equity student focus groups. •	Begin an Equity Competency framework.   As a result of the transition away from traditional grades to proficiency-based grades, educators are thinking about how we recognize and acknowledge students. They are working to expand measures of success. •	MVSD has developed and is implementing PK-adult SEL competencies. Teachers are exploring and trying strategies now.  They are beginning to plan for how to communicate student progress on these skills to students and families. •	In grades 9 and 10, MVU offers an Honors Credential instead of tracking students in homogenous groups.  Students are heterogeneously grouped but can opt into an Honors supplement, which runs as an addition to the core class.  The Honors Credential focuses on the content and work habits that students will need to be successful in college. •	The ELA department also created two Senior level English courses to help prepare students for a variety of future choices. One class was a College Writing class, where students are taught how to be successful in their college courses. The other is Technical Reading and Writing, which is a course that focuses on reading and writing skills that are used in the workforce and at trade schools.   MVU has several course offerings that use a project-based learning approach. Humanities in Action is an option that students can take to demonstrate proficiency in ELA or Social Studies.  Students conduct a sustained inquiry, engage in problem solving, and share their findings with their peers and sometimes the greater community.  In the Agriculture program, students in the Animal Science strand identify an animal that they are interested in learning more about. Faculty then acquire that animal, usually on loan, to house in the barn at MVY so that the student can learn firsthand about the animal through observation and caring for it. Additionally, students at all grade levels participate in a robust STEM Fair.  Students conduct sustained, independent research projects that focus on the Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS.  MVSD has developed the first set of Social and Emotional Learning competencies in the state of Vermont.  In a collaboration with CASEL, the SEL team developed a framework of skills, goals, and sub-goals, benchmarks, and strategies for PK through adults.  Teachers use these competencies to plan lessons that incorporate CASEL’s 3 signature practices of Welcome Activities, Engaging Strategies, and Optimistic Closings.

Educators were very intentional when they developed the hybrid schedule and procedures.   •	Students attend in person on Monday and Thursday or on Tuesday and Friday.  This was done so that students did not go more than 3 days without a connection at school.  Teachers also did not want too much time to lapse between in person sessions if students were struggling academically, socially, or emotionally. •	Leadership prepared teachers to provide in-person, remote, and virtual instruction that used the same tools and routines so that students and teachers could easily transition between formats.  Teachers intentionally preview the remote instruction on in-person days to help increase engagement. •	On remote days, interventionists provide one-on-one virtual sessions to students who need additional support.  In the spring, MVU launched one of the biggest meal distributions in the state. MVU staff worked extremely hard to meet the needs of families. Leadership feels that this established a sense of trust and caring in the community that has been essential for moving forward together. Additionally, over several years there has been foundational work focused on SEL and the importance of relationships.

After opening in 2018, Impact | PSE has proven that its model has the ability to narrow, and eventually close, the opportunity gap for historically marginalized students in south Puget Sound. Impact | PSE uses a model rooted in three design principles:  [1] Relationships: Fostering secure attachments within a tight-knit community of learners using a small group mentor model. [2] Agency: Working with families and students to develop comprehensive, personalized learning pathways for each individual scholar [3] Liberation: Creating deep, authentic learning experiences for students that lead to activism through the exploration of contextualized topics that are relevant in students’ communities.  The Impact | PSE model employs an expanded definition of student success. While Core Skills are critical to student success, Impact | PSE also believes that deeper learning skills and social-emotional skills are essential to support the next generation of equity-driven, innovative leaders. These three design principles are the foundation for achieving this vision of student success.   Impact | PSE’s implementation of a decolonized project-based learning (PBL) program is a stand-out element of the school model. The PBL curriculum has been designed to shift the dominant perspective and highlight voices, stories, and information that has not been emphasized in how students traditionally learn history. These projects lift up the indigenous perspective and work to break down institutional racism many educational systems continue to perpetuate. Impact | PSE operates with the belief that all scholars deserve to see themselves and their experiences reflected in what is being taught in their classrooms. All students deserve to learn about and be exposed to writers, artists, historians, community heroes and leaders who share their background and identity. In order for the Impact | PSE curriculum to be liberating, it must be rooted in the local communities it serves. At Impact | PSE, instructional leaders ensure that the liberated PBL model is replicable by developing a rigorous and relevant base curriculum that includes assessment tools, lesson plans and exemplars. Then, the school provides systems, structures (including a process for community/parent design input) and professional development to ensure the projects are rooted in the school community. This two-part method ensures that the curriculum is not rooted in the command, control and regurgitation of facts, but instead in the exploration of important, relevant questions that allow students to create real products and showcase them in front of a live audience of peers, parents and community members.","blended learning,designing for equity,expanded measures of success,culture of anti-racist action,project-based learning,social-emotional learning & school culture",Personalized learning plans,Yes,"Despite the obstacles and uncertainty that COVID-19 has imposed on schools and communities, Impact | Puget Sound Elementary remained committed to providing a first rate education for students and families. During the spring, Impact launched a full distance learning program blending synchronous and asynchronous instruction rooted in four key design principles: daily social emotional learning, small group/individualized instruction, decolonized project based learning, and a joyful culture of positivity. Impact | PSE’s work has been featured in news outlets, highlighted by nationally recognized education organizations, and acknowledged for going “above and beyond” during COVID-19. The effectiveness of Impact | PSE’s distance learning program was evident in the SY19-20 data. On average, 94% of scholars attend school each day during distance learning. Scholars consistently met their goals on adaptive learning platforms, and 75% of scholars met grade level benchmarks on their common core aligned adaptive literacy program. Over 95% of families stated that Impact | PSE’s response to COVID-19 met or exceeded their expectations and 100% of teachers agree or strongly agree that impact’s approach to distance learning effectively met their scholars’ needs.   Impact | PSE continued to refine the distance learning model and support mechanisms for students and families throughout 2020, while also collaborating with local and national school districts to share best practices. Impact | PSE and Impact Public Schools’ leadership have facilitated high-quality distance learning webinars and training for teachers and school leaders, building meaningful and lasting district-charter connections. This collaboration remains an important goal in the charter school movement and recalls us to the origins of charter schools as hubs for innovation and best practice dissemination.  Overwhelmingly, one of the most noteworthy aspects of Impact | PSE’s approach to COVID-19 is the relentless dedication to Brave Solidarity - the belief that diversity strengthens and enlivens us. Impact | PSE has maintained and recommitted to the importance of bringing a lens of equity and inclusion to each decision and each day. This has been particularly important during the pandemic, which has proven it the ability to widen the existing opportunity gaps for historically marginalized students. Part of living this commitment to Brave Solidarity is operating with the understanding that it is an ongoing process that does not end by meeting specific “milestones.” This anti-racist work is evident in the continuous cycle of reflection and refinement that remains at the forefront of Impact | PSE’s pandemic response.",NewSchools Venture Fund,Gabriella Netter,gnetter@newschools.org,NSVF is a funder of Impact Public Schools,"No, share only that my organization is a nominator in the Canopy process.

This has continued through the fall and it is all because the educators focus so much on building relationships.   The school's accountability rating jumped from an F to a C after just one year in the Summit Learning Program,.  Their pre-COVID focus on a strong mentoring program and teaching lifelong skills–like goal setting and knowing how to ask for help, continues to pay dividends during this very challenging time.",Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,Luis Ornelas,luis.ornelas@chanzuckerberg.com,This school is a partner school through their implementation of the Summit Learning Program.,"Yes, but share this information only with the school I nominate.
