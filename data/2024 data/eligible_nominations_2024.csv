Key points highlighted include:

2. Partnerships and Funding: The district received intentional support from the Straight A Fund in Ohio's state biennial budget, enabling them to create customized, personalized learning experiences. Partnerships with construction and architecture firms like Skanska Megen Construction Co. Inc. and SHP helped build innovative, project-based learning spaces.
3.Student Involvement in Design Process: Students from grades 6-12 actively participated in the design process of the new buildings. The design was aligned with the educational vision, focusing on six key shifts in education and incorporating hallmarks of PBL instruction.
4.Identified Foundational Needs: Through this effort, foundational needs of students were recognized, including a desire for collaboration, a student-centric culture, engaging learning opportunities, various workshop sizes, mobility within the learning environment, active engagement, and access to technology in different forms.

The district's approach not only focused on physical infrastructural changes but also on aligning the design with the educational philosophy, ensuring that the learning spaces reflect the principles of project-based learning. The active involvement of students in the process indicates a commitment to meeting their needs and preferences.

Overall, the transformation of Winton Woods School District showcases a comprehensive effort to create an environment that supports innovative and student-focused learning experiences. In addition to the district-wide transformation, the high school campus stands out for its commitment to fostering mastery-based learning. Through a range of initiatives such as assessments designed for deeper learning, grading policies centered on mastery, and an array of supplementary resources including tutoring and extended learning opportunities, we ensure students have multiple avenues to demonstrate their mastery of subjects.

School leadership, teachers, and staff challenged students to embrace high standards for learning and college/career planning. Evidence for advancing student-centered learning can be observed with the adoption of and adaption of Marzano High Reliability Schools™ framework as a part of student, faculty and staff recognitions; using the framework indicators to empower their school teaching staff and students (Source: Marzano, R. J., Phil Warrik, and Julia A. Simms. A Handbook for High Reliability Schools: The Next Step in School Reform. Marzano Research, 2014.)  By adopting such a framework, the school has expanded the framework of standards to include competencies with performance assessments and academic skills that are transferable across content areas. Compass Academy students know exactly where they are and what they need to do next. This is an important component to enhancing supportive and inclusive culture experiences as this added “a level of fun and engagement that [the school] did not predict. It’s been an excellent investment in the human capital of Compass Academy.”  This leading indicator can be seen in action through restorative practice in the classrooms, using the “Good Things” protocol from Capturing Kids’ Hearts (Capturing Kids’ Hearts: A Three-Year Program Evaluation, 2016-17 to 2018-19, May 2020, https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED606969.pdf).

With a master approach to education, their students are taught in small group instruction at instructional levels. This gives students the opportunity to work with partners and collaborate at high levels using analytical and critical thinking skills. Alturas Prep will expand on an already established program that teaches self-discipline and responsibility to all students; provides a physical environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning; promotes communication and interaction in the classroom; supports an effective environment that promotes a sense of belonging and self esteem; and provides an academic environment that promotes learning and self-fulfillment.

The Alturas International Academy uses the Primary Years Program (PYP) designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) as a curriculum framework for young learners. Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to react, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment. Like all IB programs, PYP is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas. In the process, students develop critical thinking, research, self-management, communication, and social skills.

At Alturas, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six trans-disciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry are:

Who we are
Where we are in place and time
How we express ourselves
How the world works
How we organize ourselves
Sharing the planet

Units of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, information technology, science, and social studies, helping students make meaningful connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.

INQUIRY-BASED:
The Primary Years Program (PYP) is based on a commitment to inquiry-based teaching and the development of the whole child; socially, emotionally, and intellectually. A core belief is that children learn more effectively when they are actively involved in the learning process and build upon existing knowledge in real-life contexts – In other words, when learning is relevant and engaging.

MULTILINGUAL: 
Spanish is the language of instruction in our K–5 elementary school program.  We welcome students from all language backgrounds. Over 80% of our students begin with no Spanish language at home.

NURTURING ENVIRONMENT: 
Alturas' smaller class sizes ensure that the teachers and staff can focus on students’ social and emotional development in addition to their intellectual progress. From a place of safety, students are encouraged to inquire, wonder, and investigate—to lay the foundations of interculturally sensitive and inquisitive lives.

EXPERIENCED, CARING TEACHERS: 
Alturas' teachers provide opportunities for students to build meaning and refine understanding through structured inquiry. Outside the classroom, Alturas teachers are an integral part of our community.

REAL-WORLD CONNECTIONS: 
Students synthesize and showcase their learning by applying new knowledge to real-world problems and working collaboratively to find solutions.  For example, 5th-grade students work in groups to prepare an exhibition and presentation about a topic of their choice, showcasing their self-guided learning to the community.

Westwood High School piloted ninth grade Academy Teams in fall of 2018 in an effort to support students in the transition to high school.

Since that time Westwood High School has been working to spread and scale the teaming model to expand beyond the ninth grade in innovative ways including the combining of all geometry classes and incorporating personalized learning strategies and a mix of interdisciplinary courses and specialization pathways. 

Teams use flexible space and scheduling to facilitate a variety of teaching strategies that strengthen cross-curricular connections and allow for targeted small and large group instruction.

The community partnerships program at OIA has created opportunities for students and community members to connect over shared projects — so much so that OIA was recognized in early 2022 by the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce and named Education & Workforce Development Institution of the Year. “OIA creates a love for knowledge and intellectual curiosity, and creates learners that contribute back to the local economy,” said Chamber President Candance Brake. “The community partnerships with OIA also help many people in these companies rediscover their passion. Working with young people is where you find relevance in your work for the next generation. They spark a passion that always ignited us, and help businesses reconnect with that.”
Brake also states that the students benefit from the networking aspect inherent in community partnerships. “Students will develop pathways to careers locally, and get people to become their champions — people that will help them access college, internships and eventually, a career, if they build and maintain those connections.”
At OIA, those partnerships are an essential piece to students’ college and career readiness skills, valued so highly that school leadership lobbied the district to provide a part-time staff position to manage and grow community partnerships.  
“I was handling the curriculum and the duties that come with being principal, but I knew this piece was so important. We needed dedicated resources.” The school’s community partnerships liaison splits time between teaching special education and managing community relationships for OIA; many, who Benjamin cites, return each year to collaborate on projects. “We were fortunate to have a community that bought in from the very beginning, and now, they have someone they can contact, and say, ‘we want to get on board’.”
OIA’s successful community partnerships program includes the local headquarters of businesses like Southern Star Pipeline (who provide volunteer judges and help with the school’s robotics tournaments), Puzzle Pieces, a nonprofit dedicated to helping children and adults with disabilities (where students have donated 3D puzzles they’ve created for clients) and the Chamber of Commerce that connects students with business leaders in the area. 
The sustainable structure of OIA’s project-based learning academy is a result of years of hard work, dedicated leaders and community partners, and a commitment to working through a process that provides the best outcomes for its students. “You can’t just copy [a model] and think it’s going to work,” said Benjamin. “You have to work through the process. And we wouldn’t be where we are today without our community, and those relationships, along with our curriculum and the rigor that’s part of that. New Tech Network is definitely the one to credit for that.”
