A three-person administrative team leads a staff of 160, including 100 certified teachers.  MHS staff is committed to student-centered learning (SCL)  practices. We know when our teachers learn our students learn, and we have implemented an embedded coaching model to support teachers' transition to student-centered classrooms. We have developed SCL look-fors of both teacher and students exemplars related to the four tenets of SCL.  Through our personalized learning experience program, students are able to self-design credit-bearing courses of study based around an area of interest or potential career. In addition to BOE supported Bring Your Own Device guidelines, all students are issued a Chromebook for access to anytime, anywhere learning opportunities.   To provide equitable opportunities for all students, MHS has eliminated prerequisite courses and school barriers that once prevented students from taking higher level courses. Open access substantially increased the percentage of minority, economically challenged and English Learners taking rigorous courses. The school supports a no-zero grading philosophy reinforcing the importance of work completion and credit-recovery options. The number of advanced placement and early college experience offerings has increased.  Many students graduate with numerous college credits earned. MHS is also committed to promoting positive relationships and fosters social-emotional learning through the district's Student Climate survey, Getting to Know You survey and MPS Cares self-reporting tool.  All students engage in on-track conferences with a caring adult to identify areas for growth and set goals for both short-term and long-term success. Currently, 96% of Grade 9 students are on-track to graduate in four years, and MHS has seen a 21% increase in 4-year graduation rate.

Parker Charter Essential School (Parker) has a progressive, student-centered approach to secondary schooling: our primary goal is to help adolescents learn to use their minds well; we help students learn to think, solve problems, and become resilient, resourceful learners. Our mastery-based promotion system is built on portfolios of high-quality student work products and public exhibitions of learning rather than traditional letter grades or grade point averages. Other key design features include robust teacher collaboration and team-teaching, personal learning plans for each student, early-career teacher induction, and outward-facing dissemination efforts.     Parker is a regional public school located in Central Massachusetts, comprised of students in grades 7-12, primarily from Worcester and Middlesex Counties.  The school is located in Devens, a former military base, which is currently in the process of redevelopment and revitalization. In addition to the charter public school, Parker increases its impact internationally by running an influential professional development center on its campus.

The loops have cross content connections, which ask students to learn about topics and concepts with more depth. For example, students may be exploring the loop """"Movement."""" While doing this they may learn about art and music movements, learn the math and physics of motion, explore the historical and geographical reasons why people have moved, explore and practice movement used in exercise, and read literature around movements like the Civil Rights. As students develop the skills and knowledge on the topic, we will guide them as they develop presentations and projects as ways to demonstrate learning and impact their community. Then, students may take the information to look at the future of movement or create something that utilizes motion or artistic movements. We call them loops because by the end, the students will be able to complete the loop by informing others about the topic through their innovation.

We believe people grow best when they're learning; That they learn best when they're creating; And that they create best when they're creating something which matters to them.  We believe these things are true regardless of age.  Despite all the differences between adults and youth, we believe the ways they learn and grow rhyme, that they're more similar than different.  Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to look at the most effective, creative workplaces, studios, and labs, and build such a place with youth, here in Somerville, grounded in two, basic activities: telling stories and building things with computers.  Our mission is to restore power, dignity, and play to youth.  We believe that to do that, youth can't be students, they can't be largely passive recipients of information.  They have to learn to identify problems and questions they care about and pursue them.  This is why at Powderhouse Studios, people mostly do projects.  When youth first join us, these projects come from their involvement in staff's ongoing work and the seminars staff put together around this work.  As youth get older, they spend more and more time articulating and developing projects of their own design.  By the time a young person leaves Powderhouse Studios, they'll be comfortable tackling year-long, 1,000 hour projects.  But to do that, at some point they must do a 500 hour project, and a 100 hour project, and so on, all the way down to whatever timescale they can manage when we first meet them.  But doing this well means we must support deep, and deeply individualized, work by young people.  To do this, we've gotten rid of traditional, subject-based classes and teaching positions.  Instead, the day is organized in three chunks: morning, lunch, and afternoon, 10AM to 5PM each day.  Staff work in tightly knit, cross-functional teams which stick together, managing mixed age cohorts of about thirty young people for years at a time.  And that's just the start.  Doing all this in a traditional district environment has proven quite hard.  We've had to deal with the many, many complications our model introduces. everything from union contracts to procurement. Throughout, people have told us we're crazy.  And what we're describing might sound crazy.  But it's how creative work has been done for centuries, from apprenticeships to MFA programs to kindergarten classrooms.

The Valor Compass, our nationally recognized comprehensive human development program, is designed to help scholars develop their Sharp Minds as they strengthen their Big Hearts.   Built to Last: We believe that being built-to-last means to have strong, long-term operational infrastructure.

Mentoring & Choice  Students meet with their mentor every week to develop the mindsets, skills, and habits of productivity. Working with families, mentors gradually transition students to college-style self-directed learning. Students guide this transition, earning more scheduling choice as they make responsible study decisions.  Project-Based Learning  To prepare students for 21st-century careers, Kairos coursework trades mindless memorization for creative, hands-on projects. The world is our classroom, and students learn about it firsthand through experiential field trips and internships.  Civic Leadership  Kairos students do more than just talk about leadership.

Our preferred future of learning recognizes the contributions of all to teach learners in a flexible, adaptive, and culturally-responsive method. The current system places focus on assessment scores in order to fund and provide opportunities for progress in education. State, national, and cognitive assessments focus on the deficits of a learner, institution or potential future. Present models in education tend to be deficit-based. They highlight the problems of a child, such as a child’s (dis)ability and focus on what is “missing” instead of what can be accomplished. Deficit-based models lead to a downward spiral of burnout and depression among students and staff. Our preferred future of learning focuses on the individual learner with an asset-based approach, highlighting their individual strengths and designing a curriculum based on their needs and desired future.   Our preferred future centers on a curriculum that commits to justice and equity. Our preferred future curriculum recognizes the collective impacts of all members in society and champions their contributions. This future understands that there will be constant work toward a more perfect union and provides all learners with an authentic education focused on the diverse cultures of our world. We will center our curriculum development on justice and equity, highlighting the lost voices of the past in our readings, videos, and learning materials. We will enable every learner and their family to flourish by centering the instruction on their individual needs and progress. The team-effort in the child’s instruction will allow all voices to be heard and will focus on the child’s abilities and needs in order to succeed in their future. Our just future includes a curriculum as diverse as our world in voices and materials where every learner has the voice to determine their criteria for success.   Our work focuses on student engagement in universal individualized educational programs using a Montessori educational theory based curriculum with instructional sources from global perspectives. An Individualized Learning Program (ILP) is developed for each child. This allows for a team approach to a child’s education and will document both successes and goals toward the progress of each individual child. Finally, we seek to emerge by providing all children a Glocal Curriculum (Hale & Fisher, 2013). Children learn locally, but seek to make change globally in the world. In order to accomplish this, we need to ensure that the curriculum is a global curriculum, providing for diverse perspectives and experiences.  We see evidence of improving the curriculum through resources like the 1619 Project (New York Times, 2019). By using multiple media, articles, live events, podcasts, the project sought to reframe the country’s history and highlight the contributions of Black Americans in the United States. Ensuring that the African-American story was told, the 1619 project, made black writers an essential element of the story of the United States.

Vision: Happy Kids, Engaged in Healthy Relationships, on a Path to Gainful Employment.   Our Approach:   Signature design elements at all grade levels will serve as a catalyst for creating interest-based, authentic learning opportunities unique to each student. Design elements include:  Advisory  Often described as a “second family” by students, an advisory is a core organizational and relational structure that nurtures belonging. Learners stay with an advisor and a group of fellow classmates for multiple years, building close personal relationships that last a lifetime. Advisory experiences intentionally cultivate a learner-centered mindset by inspiring learners to develop the agency, skills, dispositions, and abilities needed to take charge of their learning journey. Advisors stand alongside students as they explore their passions and interests and help students turn challenges into learning opportunities.  Competency-based  Each student is a unique individual with knowledge, skills, and dispositions developed through learning experiences inside and outside school. Our competency-based system creates equitable learning structures and conditions that empower each student to meet rigorous, common expectations for learning through timely, differentiated support. Central to our approach is an intense focus on student growth through meaningful feedback and permission for them to show how they are progressing in many ways.  World of Work A national leader in early childhood career development, the Cajon Valley World of Work initiative engages students in hands-on experience right in their classrooms with a wide variety of careers, preparing them for their futures. World of Work uses each student’s interests, values, and strengths to tailor exploration, simulations, and virtual field trips with career professionals. Beginning in the Freshman year, all high school and post-secondary students will leverage early childhood interest exploration to identify and serve off-campus internships with highly qualified mentors. Local partners such as San Diego Workforce Partnership and Biocom are already playing a role in defining World of Work opportunities and engaging with our students.  Difference Making On-campus studio exploration empowers student entrepreneurs, makers, and inventors to impact their communities and world through their work and ideas. Students engage in community-based projects that tap their interests and strengths to make a meaningful difference in others’ lives. Their impact is amplified by our school’s multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural approach to learning. An example may include designing, building, and installing an equine sensory trail for children with autism.  Family Connection Accomplishing our vision challenges us to think differently about how we work together with students, families, and our community. Truly personalizing education beyond mere academic work involves looking at each student holistically. Families know their children best and they must play a proactive role in their children’s learning, collaborating in the planning and assessment of their student’s work.  Reimagining Postsecondary  Our goal is to push beyond dual and concurrent enrollment in community college to a coherent TK-14 experience, moving toward a strengths-based, truly personalized postsecondary experience that results in gainful employment opportunities in our immediate community. It is not our intent to partner with a community college to mirror or offer their program. Rather, create an integrated approach that builds on our World of Work initiative by extending internship and coursework beyond high school. Post high school students will maintain a relationship with an industry mentor and receive “wrap-around” services. Their Bostonia advisor, social worker, career counselor, and support staff will ensure an Associates’ degree and/or certificate of completion.",NA,NA,"75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","White",NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,1,8,5,10,9,6,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wintern@cajonvalley.net","Nerel Winter","CEO","wintern@cajonvalley.net","Nerel Winter","CEO","NewSchools Venture Fund"

With the goal of developing students into independent and influential citizens within their local and global communities, BELIEVE has intentionally designed supports and programming that meet the needs of our families and students.   Instruction & Curriculum Double Blocked ELA: Our double-blocked ELA sequence in 9th and 10th grade supports students by accelerating their completion of high school course credit requirements as well as remediating any learning gaps from students’ K-8 instruction, and creating more flexibility for career certification courses.  Gifted & Talented Accelerated Track: We recognize that while some students enter high school with significant learning gaps, others enter high school ready for greater challenges and having already earned some high school math credit. We support students who are ready for advanced learning by adjusting their schedules to enroll them in dual enrollment courses and higher level high school math courses as early as ninth grade. While many large high schools offer accelerated paths for gifted and talented students, BELIEVE provides a gifted and talented option within the attentive and close-knit setting of a small school.    Montessori Principles: In the Montessori model, the child directs their own learning pathway. BSTLA mirrors this in the Villages model that each student is a part of from the time they enroll at BELEIVE.   Individualized Learning Plan: Within a school community, the learning needs are as many and varied as the students. Although we believe that all students should have access to instruction that is informed by the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), we also believe that all students should have access to high school learning pathways that best meet their individual needs and goals. At BELIEVE, we take a student-centered approach to scheduling, in alignment with our “Child-Centered” school value. Each students’ schedule is made by hand, and is informed by both qualitative and quantitative data.   Culture  BELIEVE’s culture system is unique and truly one of a kind. As it was created and developed by the founding team and refined over the first two years of operation, expectation and culture systems are designed specifically for the students that we serve. Mirroring the standard corporate ladder, the Level Up System (LUS), was designed to provide students with real-world expectations and practices so they are prepared for life after college. The LUS was crafted to help students develop autonomy and agency so they can be self-sufficient, starters, and critical thinkers. This system, or the privileges accessed through it, are common in affluent neighborhoods and districts; however, not in black and brown communities. BELIEVE is changing that.

We achieve this approach in four powerful ways:  1. Joyfully Rigorous Learning. I Dream PCS learners learn how to learn. They engage in learning that makes them think deeply and delve into challenging text and math problems like detectives. They experiment, write, problem-solve, and research independently and with their peers and adults (called “coaches” instead of “teachers”) to learn Common Core State Standards and to answer their questions about themselves and the world around them. It’s the challenges that make them grow and learn who they are.  2. Dream Time. I Dream PCS learners have weekly Dream Time to identify and explore a curiosity or interest they want to learn about. Curiosity breeds deep learning and innovation. Coaches working with learners conference with and observe them in Dream Time to document the skills learners use in their deep learning and to guide them to transfer the skills and knowledge to their academic learning, or apply the Common Core State Standards they learn in academic classes in Dream Time.   3. Social-Emotional Learning. Research shows that learners who engage in social-emotional learning demonstrate better academic performance, positive attitudes and reduced stress. I Dream PCS learners meet daily in Community Time with their coaches and classmates to develop their emotional intelligence and healthy relationships with themselves and others.  4. Customized learning. A Customized Learning Plan (CLP) is a living document created with each learner, their family and coaches to identify learning targets and action steps towards mastery of math, literacy, social-emotional learning, and dreamer goals. CLPs are a learner-centered assessment practice to build ownership of learning through continuous goal-setting, reflection and mastery of standards.

Let’s start with a story.  “How can we reduce the environmental and social impact of our shops?” The managers of Pinwheel Coffee and Framework Cycles asked this to Embark students early in the school year. And, they spent the next two months answering it. Students started with an environmental audit of the shops. They identified issues like plastic and paper use, rubber and metal waste, production of coffee, tea, and milk, and materials that bikes and components are made of, among other things.   In many places, the learning would stop there but at Embark we strive to go deeper. Guided by the educators, students explored their chosen issue. In science, they tackled topics such as properties of matter, chemical change, and erosion. In social studies, they identified countries where key products are grown, mined, or produced. They researched government structures and policies related to their issue to understand the impact.  What really sets Embark apart is that the learning and work has real meaning and impact.  Students used their research to create formal presentations to the shop managers. Once accepted, students got to actually implement their recommendations in the shops. Students wrote the text and designed posters to inform Pinwheel patrons about why almond milk now costs extra. They worked with bike manufacturers to stock new more sustainable brands at Framework. They worked with the local government and nonprofits to create a rubber recycling program for used bike tubes. In short, they made real change happen.",NA,NA,"0 - 24% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,9,2,10,5,3,4,1,7,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"meganp@embarkeducation.org","Megan Parry","Director of Embark Education","meganp@embarkeducation.org","Megan Parry","Director of Embark Education","Moonshot EdVentures, Education Reimagined"

This statement recognizes that every student brings their unique abilities, interests, needs, circumstances, and context into school and into their learning. At Durango Big Picture High School, each student is part of an advisory, a learning community, led by a supportive advisor who guides students to identify their needs and interests which are in turn formed into negotiated learning plans and goals that make learning personal, engaging, and relevant. A student-driven curriculum is developed around real world experiences, relevant competencies, and standards-driven learning targets. The student is the curriculum and the school is the community.  All students are challenged to pursue their interests and are supported by a community of educators, professionals, and family members. Big Picture Learning supports the concept of ‘leaving-to-learn’ which enables the powerful learning that occurs when students leave their school as part of the school program to expand and deepen their learning, to get exposure to new ideas, people and opportunities, and to learn through their interests in the best places where those interests are happening - in real-world settings and workplaces in relationship with adults.  “We know that learning happens best when interests, relationships, and practice are woven together. People learn more quickly, more deeply, more comprehensively, and more meaningfully when they are pursuing their interests with skilled people who know them and let them practice, play, make mistakes, start over again, ask more questions, test things out and then show what they can do.” – Elliot Washer BPL’s relational rather than transactional approach to youth helps them learn about who they are and how they can best contribute.

We all know the world of work is changing, and education should too. That’s why we’re building a better future together.   We are caring.  At ACE, we make sure every student gets one-on-one support.

We hold each other accountable and bring out the best in each other so that we can build a better future together.   We are grounded. ACE offers practical experiences and expert connections that prepare our students for success in life and work. We are free, local, and public, and we have been firmly grounded in our community since 2010. At ACE we pair hands-on projects with highly engaged teachers and staff.  We make sure that every student — whether returning to school after an absence, raising a family, or holding down a job — has the individualized support they need to succeed.  We are connected. At ACE, we know that when we work as a team, everyone wins. That’s why we build connections between students, educators, community partners, and industry leaders to bring out the best in all of us. We actively engage with our local neighborhoods to provide resources and support for a healthy community. Every year we connect ACE students to industry leaders for mentorship and real life learning opportunities. New Mexico professionals join us in the classroom and help design our projects.

2023,44,"Common Ground High School","358 Springside Ave.","New Haven","Connecticut","New Haven Ecology Project","http://www.commongroundct.org","090001400807","Public charter school","Urban",0,0,1,225,0,0,0.78,0.33,0.41,0.03,0,0.22,0.05,0.64,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Common Ground has planted the seeds of a student-centered model of urban public high school education that leverages the larger learning ecosystem to help all students succeed in and beyond high school. We are growing these seeds into an integrated, responsive, student-centered, community-rooted model of urban public secondary education.  What if all 9th and 10th graders experienced a rich set of interdisciplinary, community-based learning experiences, culminating in performances and products for real audiences? What if our students’ 9th and 10th grade experiences were built to help them navigate and succeed in learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom, preparing them for more independent work in junior and senior years?   In 9th grade, as students are first finding Common Ground, their experiences starts close to home -- focused on their own identity, our 20-acre campus, and their place in our community.  The year starts with an immersion in Common Ground’s urban farm, and in questions related to this place -- how we feed ourselves and meet our other basic needs, how we build a food system is fair and just, how energy flows through our food system, what math tells us about what Common Ground’s urban farm should grow. Students move from this focus on basic needs to a study of how to survive and thrive in a diverse community, and then  explore how we create positive change in the places we call home. Each unit culminates in a real performance for a public audience: presenting a variety of work at a family food night, for instance. Through these experiences, students make measurable and significant growth as readers, writers, and problem-solvers -- and gain the skills they need to navigate and advocate in a variety of learning settings. Because a team of teachers share these new students and the curriculum is built to help students share their experiences, teachers can be responsive to the young people in front of them.   In 10th grade, students turn from their own campus and identity to the City of New Haven as a whole.  Four integrated units -- New Haven Stories, Justice & Change, Climate & Power, and Community Health -- push students to explore the systems and dynamics that have shaped our city, and how they can help to create a more just and sustainable community. Student venture out into the city throughout each unit -- connecting with neighborhood leaders, exploring neighborhood change, helping policymakers develop solutions to real problems -- and community members regularly push in to roles as co-teachers. Again, each unit challenges students to synthesize and share their learning for an authentic audience: building a website and photo essay about their New Haven stories, producing an original piece of theater that enacts and intervenes in injustice, creating public art that helps address climate change, producing video public service announcements that help create a healthier community. The expectations of students ramp up, as they prepare to take greater control of their educational path in grades 11 and 12.   These experiences will be grounded in a common set of design principles, co-created by Common Ground students and teachers -- the foundational building blocks of teaching and learning at Common Ground. Through extended units of study, students will tackle questions and problems that hit close to home – relevant and responsive to their own lives, and the communities and cultures they call home. These interdisciplinary units will integrate core disciplinary standards and teachers from math, science, ELA, and social studies into a deep learning experience that takes up half of students’ school day. Through start-of-unit expeditions, ongoing field work, and culminating performances for public audiences, students will experience and develop skills for navigating a larger learning ecosystem. These experiences will also be designed to build students’ capacity as leaders, change agents, and social justice advocates – rooted in Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework.  Students will have real and growing voice and agency about what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate learning – and universal design will support the participation of all students.   What if all juniors and seniors were able to curate their own learning plan, with support from their academic advisors, integrating college courses, work experiences, internships, elective courses, and core academic offerings?   As students move into their last two years of high school, they will take increasing control of their own education. A core junior seminar will ground their experience, in which they will build skills for action research, explore college and career options, and identify expanded learning opportunities that match their interests. The following year, a Senior Environmental Justice Capstone will support students as they refine college essays, conduct college-level research on social and environmental challenges, take on capstone projects that address these challenges, and prepare to defend their leadership portfolios.    We know, as well, that core academic classes will form a key part of every student’s schedule, and that these courses will include opportunities for community-based field work, culminating performances for public audiences, and learning that is tied to college, career, and community leadership. We are fully committed to a vertically aligned, scaffolded experience in the core subjects that ensures that all students graduate college-ready.   In the context of these anchor experiences, the junior and senior experience will consistently blur the line between school and the larger community, between school day and out-of-school time. All of our juniors and seniors will participate in a combination of early college courses, work-based learning opportunities, internships, and credit-bearing out-of-school opportunities. Many will travel to Southern Connecticut State University, just around the corner from Common Ground’s campus, for a part of their school day. Community organizations will push into the school day and building in more robust ways, as well; for instance, the education director from a local theater company teaches a course on using devised theater methodologies to confront social justice challenges. Students will earn credit by documenting learning in out-of-school programs, work placements, and internships.  Some students will develop their own learning experiences from the ground up.  The mix of these types of experiences vary from student to student. Some will opt for more traditional high school experiences, while others will participate more in the wider learning ecosystem.    What if experiences through Green Jobs Corps, Common Ground’s urban farm and community programs, and out-of-school opportunities were intentionally connected with academic classes, so that students had a chance to practice skills and understandings developed in their courses in the workplace and other out-of-school settings? What if all students built and explored their own pathways through their four years of high school, integrating experiences in a wide range of learning environments?     Some students will choose to blaze their own pathways, while others will find one that’s well trodden already. The farm immersion unit in the 9th grade core prepares students for a community-based exploration of food justice and access in the 10th grade core. Students can choose to dive deeper into these questions through an elective course on food justice, perhaps leading into a farm internship, a paid work opportunity through our Green Jobs Corps, farm-based after-school programs, and/or a senior project.  Students will explore pathways to college, as well. Every 9th grader makes it onto the campus of Southern Connecticut State University  -- touring campus, participating in workshops led by undergraduates, and accessing campus resources. As sophomores, they will collaborate with Southern’s public health department to take on community-based health research, and work with a theater company housed at Southern to create Theater of the Oppressed-style productions. They will be able to take a course on Common Ground’s campus, taught by Southern faculty and bearing college credit. They can also choose to take courses for free at SCSU -- and are more likely to experience success because of the supports that are in place.   What if students’ leadership portfolio and school-wide leadership framework were tools for documenting mastery and growth in non-academic and academic competencies, across all of these experiences and settings? What if our students’ academic advisors worked with students and their families to create and leverage the mix of learning opportunities that were right for them?      When students participate in a program at the Peabody Museum, or an internship in our Nature Year program, they and the staff who supervise them will document their learning goals and outcomes using Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework – earning credit by demonstrating growth and mastery of transferable skills. Working with Common Ground’s art teacher, they will demonstrate how these out-of-school experiences demonstrate mastery of subject area standards, as well – allowing them to earn advanced art credit toward graduation.  Similarly, the grades and feedback that students receive in their Common Ground courses will reflect both students’ growth in transferable leadership skills, and their mastery of academic standards.   Students’ advisors will help students identify and dive into experiences that match their interests, and will coordinate with the staff responsible for overseeing expanded learning to ensure that a clear learning plan is in place. Over four years of high school, students’ work in advisory will have scaffolded deep growth in non-academic domains: supporting social/emotional development, increased agency and leadership capacity, college and career exploration, and the goal-setting and follow-through skills needed to take control of their educational experience. By the time they graduate, students will have built and defended a rich electronic portfolio that integrates academic learning and leadership competencies. It will be the norm to share these portfolios with college admissions offices and prospective employers. Students’ transcripts will also reflect growth and mastery through this rich engagement with the wider learning ecosystem.  What if -- through these experiences and the flexible pathways that connect them -- every Common Ground student graduated ready for college success (recognizing that some students will choose to pursue other paths), powerful environmental justice leadership, meaningful careers, and healthy, happy, whole, sustainable lives? That is our ultimate vision: That students choose their own path AND meet universally high expectations for growth and competence.",0,1,"25 - 49% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Woman","Black",NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,9,5,7,1,2,4,10,6,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jtolman@commongroundct.org","Joel Tolman","Director of Community Impact & Engagement","jtolman@commongroundct.org","Joel Tolman","Director of Community Impact & Engagement","Anonymous"

We are growing these seeds into an integrated, responsive, student-centered, community-rooted model of urban public secondary education.  What if all 9th and 10th graders experienced a rich set of interdisciplinary, community-based learning experiences, culminating in performances and products for real audiences? What if our students’ 9th and 10th grade experiences were built to help them navigate and succeed in learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom, preparing them for more independent work in junior and senior years?   In 9th grade, as students are first finding Common Ground, their experiences starts close to home -- focused on their own identity, our 20-acre campus, and their place in our community.  The year starts with an immersion in Common Ground’s urban farm, and in questions related to this place -- how we feed ourselves and meet our other basic needs, how we build a food system is fair and just, how energy flows through our food system, what math tells us about what Common Ground’s urban farm should grow. Students move from this focus on basic needs to a study of how to survive and thrive in a diverse community, and then  explore how we create positive change in the places we call home. Each unit culminates in a real performance for a public audience: presenting a variety of work at a family food night, for instance. Through these experiences, students make measurable and significant growth as readers, writers, and problem-solvers -- and gain the skills they need to navigate and advocate in a variety of learning settings. Because a team of teachers share these new students and the curriculum is built to help students share their experiences, teachers can be responsive to the young people in front of them.   In 10th grade, students turn from their own campus and identity to the City of New Haven as a whole.  Four integrated units -- New Haven Stories, Justice & Change, Climate & Power, and Community Health -- push students to explore the systems and dynamics that have shaped our city, and how they can help to create a more just and sustainable community. Student venture out into the city throughout each unit -- connecting with neighborhood leaders, exploring neighborhood change, helping policymakers develop solutions to real problems -- and community members regularly push in to roles as co-teachers. Again, each unit challenges students to synthesize and share their learning for an authentic audience: building a website and photo essay about their New Haven stories, producing an original piece of theater that enacts and intervenes in injustice, creating public art that helps address climate change, producing video public service announcements that help create a healthier community. The expectations of students ramp up, as they prepare to take greater control of their educational path in grades 11 and 12.   These experiences will be grounded in a common set of design principles, co-created by Common Ground students and teachers -- the foundational building blocks of teaching and learning at Common Ground. Through extended units of study, students will tackle questions and problems that hit close to home – relevant and responsive to their own lives, and the communities and cultures they call home. These interdisciplinary units will integrate core disciplinary standards and teachers from math, science, ELA, and social studies into a deep learning experience that takes up half of students’ school day. Through start-of-unit expeditions, ongoing field work, and culminating performances for public audiences, students will experience and develop skills for navigating a larger learning ecosystem. These experiences will also be designed to build students’ capacity as leaders, change agents, and social justice advocates – rooted in Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework.  Students will have real and growing voice and agency about what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate learning – and universal design will support the participation of all students.   What if all juniors and seniors were able to curate their own learning plan, with support from their academic advisors, integrating college courses, work experiences, internships, elective courses, and core academic offerings?   As students move into their last two years of high school, they will take increasing control of their own education. A core junior seminar will ground their experience, in which they will build skills for action research, explore college and career options, and identify expanded learning opportunities that match their interests. The following year, a Senior Environmental Justice Capstone will support students as they refine college essays, conduct college-level research on social and environmental challenges, take on capstone projects that address these challenges, and prepare to defend their leadership portfolios.    We know, as well, that core academic classes will form a key part of every student’s schedule, and that these courses will include opportunities for community-based field work, culminating performances for public audiences, and learning that is tied to college, career, and community leadership. We are fully committed to a vertically aligned, scaffolded experience in the core subjects that ensures that all students graduate college-ready.   In the context of these anchor experiences, the junior and senior experience will consistently blur the line between school and the larger community, between school day and out-of-school time. All of our juniors and seniors will participate in a combination of early college courses, work-based learning opportunities, internships, and credit-bearing out-of-school opportunities. Many will travel to Southern Connecticut State University, just around the corner from Common Ground’s campus, for a part of their school day. Community organizations will push into the school day and building in more robust ways, as well; for instance, the education director from a local theater company teaches a course on using devised theater methodologies to confront social justice challenges. Students will earn credit by documenting learning in out-of-school programs, work placements, and internships.  Some students will develop their own learning experiences from the ground up.  The mix of these types of experiences vary from student to student. Some will opt for more traditional high school experiences, while others will participate more in the wider learning ecosystem.    What if experiences through Green Jobs Corps, Common Ground’s urban farm and community programs, and out-of-school opportunities were intentionally connected with academic classes, so that students had a chance to practice skills and understandings developed in their courses in the workplace and other out-of-school settings? What if all students built and explored their own pathways through their four years of high school, integrating experiences in a wide range of learning environments?     Some students will choose to blaze their own pathways, while others will find one that’s well trodden already. The farm immersion unit in the 9th grade core prepares students for a community-based exploration of food justice and access in the 10th grade core. Students can choose to dive deeper into these questions through an elective course on food justice, perhaps leading into a farm internship, a paid work opportunity through our Green Jobs Corps, farm-based after-school programs, and/or a senior project.  Students will explore pathways to college, as well. Every 9th grader makes it onto the campus of Southern Connecticut State University  -- touring campus, participating in workshops led by undergraduates, and accessing campus resources. As sophomores, they will collaborate with Southern’s public health department to take on community-based health research, and work with a theater company housed at Southern to create Theater of the Oppressed-style productions. They will be able to take a course on Common Ground’s campus, taught by Southern faculty and bearing college credit. They can also choose to take courses for free at SCSU -- and are more likely to experience success because of the supports that are in place.   What if students’ leadership portfolio and school-wide leadership framework were tools for documenting mastery and growth in non-academic and academic competencies, across all of these experiences and settings? What if our students’ academic advisors worked with students and their families to create and leverage the mix of learning opportunities that were right for them?      When students participate in a program at the Peabody Museum, or an internship in our Nature Year program, they and the staff who supervise them will document their learning goals and outcomes using Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework – earning credit by demonstrating growth and mastery of transferable skills. Working with Common Ground’s art teacher, they will demonstrate how these out-of-school experiences demonstrate mastery of subject area standards, as well – allowing them to earn advanced art credit toward graduation.  Similarly, the grades and feedback that students receive in their Common Ground courses will reflect both students’ growth in transferable leadership skills, and their mastery of academic standards.   Students’ advisors will help students identify and dive into experiences that match their interests, and will coordinate with the staff responsible for overseeing expanded learning to ensure that a clear learning plan is in place. Over four years of high school, students’ work in advisory will have scaffolded deep growth in non-academic domains: supporting social/emotional development, increased agency and leadership capacity, college and career exploration, and the goal-setting and follow-through skills needed to take control of their educational experience. By the time they graduate, students will have built and defended a rich electronic portfolio that integrates academic learning and leadership competencies. It will be the norm to share these portfolios with college admissions offices and prospective employers. Students’ transcripts will also reflect growth and mastery through this rich engagement with the wider learning ecosystem.  What if -- through these experiences and the flexible pathways that connect them -- every Common Ground student graduated ready for college success (recognizing that some students will choose to pursue other paths), powerful environmental justice leadership, meaningful careers, and healthy, happy, whole, sustainable lives? That is our ultimate vision: That students choose their own path AND meet universally high expectations for growth and competence.",0,1,"25 - 49% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"jtolman@commongroundct.org","Joel Tolman","Director of Community Impact & Engagement",NA,NA,NA,"Anonymous"

Let’s start with a story.  “How can we reduce the environmental and social impact of our shops?” The managers of Pinwheel Coffee and Framework Cycles asked this to Embark students early in the school year. And, they spent the next two months answering it. Students started with an environmental audit of the shops. They identified issues like plastic and paper use, rubber and metal waste, production of coffee, tea, and milk, and materials that bikes and components are made of, among other things.   In many places, the learning would stop there but at Embark we strive to go deeper. Guided by the educators, students explored their chosen issue. In science, they tackled topics such as properties of matter, chemical change, and erosion. In social studies, they identified countries where key products are grown, mined, or produced. They researched government structures and policies related to their issue to understand the impact.  What really sets Embark apart is that the learning and work has real meaning and impact.  Students used their research to create formal presentations to the shop managers. Once accepted, students got to actually implement their recommendations in the shops. Students wrote the text and designed posters to inform Pinwheel patrons about why almond milk now costs extra. They worked with bike manufacturers to stock new more sustainable brands at Framework. They worked with the local government and nonprofits to create a rubber recycling program for used bike tubes. In short, they made real change happen.",NA,NA,"0 - 24% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Latinx",NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"brianh@embarkeducation.org","Brian Hyosaka","Head of School","miguel@greatworkinc.org","Miguel Gonzalez","Executive Director","Moonshot EdVentures, Education Reimagined"

Technology also connects learners on a local and global level, to foster communication, collaboration, and creativity. Students now, more than ever, are equipped with the tools to innovate, to reimagine their education, and to serve as pioneers in both existing and new fields.   Preparing students for an unpredictable future requires a variety of knowledge, skills, and dispositions.  -As global citizens, students must be able to demonstrate an understanding of others’ needs and understand the value of a diversity of experiences, cultures, and perspectives.  -As solution seekers they need to be able to recognize obstacles, diagnose the issues that limit progress, apply strategies to address their concerns, and reflect on the effectiveness of their response.  -As skillful collaborators, students to work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams in a variety of formats.  -As inspired innovators, they need to be able to elaborate, refine, analyze, evaluate, and iterate their ideas in order to maximize their creative efforts. -As mindful learners, they need to be able to regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they persist toward personal and learning goals.  -As effective communicators, they must articulate and listen with attention to knowledge, values, attitudes, and intentions.    Although we recognize the changing realities of the modern world, there are current aspects of our professional work that remain important for the future of Nipmuc.

As our world evolves, our professional practices must reflect and include opportunities to collaborate, reflect, innovate, and initiate.

In a typical trimester, a student will participate in two different studios designed by our team of expert coaches. Each trimester ends with an open innovation period during which students have the freedom to dig deeper into a topic of particular interest from earlier in the term.  In studios designed for younger students, our coaches focus on supporting the development of foundational skills and creative confidence. As students learn to navigate open-ended problems, collaborate effectively, build empathy for others and communicate their ideas using a variety of media, studios become more sophisticated.

This ensures that each child, at every academic level, will experience growth with the goal of reaching grade level proficiency.  Our scholars take ownership of their education and collaborate with teachers to create individual learning plans that identify their goals for academic growth and incorporate parent participation.  We continually measure scholar growth, which allows us to determine the specific areas in which a scholar needs more care and attention.

The learning environment allows students to develop in these areas in multiple ways. Students participate in daily circle activities where they can deepen their understanding of themselves and their community. We use restorative practices to repair and minimize harm, allowing for student's to develop a myriad of personal skills. Students co-create curriculum at the beginning of each year with their teachers. This includes, but is not limited to, proposing topics, self-assessing their own work, developing their own projects and courses, and leading learning activities themselves. We also design our curricula to maximize credit-earning opportunities within a competency-based model, which helps students who are under-credited for their age can catch up and move forward.

In Design Studio, we want to ensure that students graduate prepared for the college of today, as well as the college of tomorrow. If there is one thing our community knows, it is that being flexibly educated, being able to learn not just about things, but HOW to learn, prepares you for whatever a changing world might throw at you. At its very core, that is what Design Studio is all about.  We do this by helping students truly master the subjects they are learning–while at the same time making sure that students are learning how to learn. We are a Mastery-Based program, so when students undertake a topic to learn, whether it be Algebra 2 or Physics or Entrepreneurship, students have academic goals to reach before they move on. You can be assured that when a student finishes a topic in Design Studio, and meets the mastery goals, that student will know that topic, and even more importantly how to use that topic in other settings.  The Design Studio at Mead is a multi-age, multi-disciplinary community that is four or five periods.  Because students spend their core classes with us, we believe that it provides a very cohesive experience into high school from middle school, or transitioning from grade level to grade level. Students have both adult mentors AND peer mentors to help them navigate Mead High School. Students have the opportunity to “go out” from the Studio and take other classes that they might be interested in, or that they are required to take.

We achieve this approach in four powerful ways:  1. Joyfully Rigorous Learning. I Dream PCS learners learn how to learn. They engage in learning that makes them think deeply and delve into challenging text and math problems like detectives. They experiment, write, problem-solve, and research independently and with their peers and adults (called “coaches” instead of “teachers”) to learn Common Core State Standards and to answer their questions about themselves and the world around them. It’s the challenges that make them grow and learn who they are.  2. Dream Time. I Dream PCS learners have weekly Dream Time to identify and explore a curiosity or interest they want to learn about. Curiosity breeds deep learning and innovation. Coaches working with learners conference with and observe them in Dream Time to document the skills learners use in their deep learning and to guide them to transfer the skills and knowledge to their academic learning, or apply the Common Core State Standards they learn in academic classes in Dream Time.   3. Social-Emotional Learning. Research shows that learners who engage in social-emotional learning demonstrate better academic performance, positive attitudes and reduced stress. I Dream PCS learners meet daily in Community Time with their coaches and classmates to develop their emotional intelligence and healthy relationships with themselves and others.  4. Customized learning. A Customized Learning Plan (CLP) is a living document created with each learner, their family and coaches to identify learning targets and action steps towards mastery of math, literacy, social-emotional learning, and dreamer goals. CLPs are a learner-centered assessment practice to build ownership of learning through continuous goal-setting, reflection and mastery of standards.

Through our project based, real world curriculum and programmatic structure, we are ensuring that our students are equipped to display academic and SEL competency, through community-based, place-based classrooms.    As we grow and develop in the coming years, we see our students as leaders in our school and local communities, functioning as agents of change with the knowledge and skills they have developed in the classroom and through their relationships with NYC business and non-profit industries.  We believe: if given the opportunity to study something in depth that they truly care about, young people will empower themselves to explore their passions, transform communities, and create a more beautiful world.",NA,NA,"50 - 74% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Woman","Latinx",NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"Vcoleman3@schools.nyc.gov","Veronica Coleman","Principal",NA,NA,NA,"NewSchools Venture Fund"

Vision: Happy Kids, Engaged in Healthy Relationships, on a Path to Gainful Employment.   Our Approach:   Signature design elements at all grade levels will serve as a catalyst for creating interest-based, authentic learning opportunities unique to each student. Design elements include:  Advisory  Often described as a “second family” by students, an advisory is a core organizational and relational structure that nurtures belonging. Learners stay with an advisor and a group of fellow classmates for multiple years, building close personal relationships that last a lifetime. Advisory experiences intentionally cultivate a learner-centered mindset by inspiring learners to develop the agency, skills, dispositions, and abilities needed to take charge of their learning journey. Advisors stand alongside students as they explore their passions and interests and help students turn challenges into learning opportunities.  Competency-based  Each student is a unique individual with knowledge, skills, and dispositions developed through learning experiences inside and outside school. Our competency-based system creates equitable learning structures and conditions that empower each student to meet rigorous, common expectations for learning through timely, differentiated support. Central to our approach is an intense focus on student growth through meaningful feedback and permission for them to show how they are progressing in many ways.  World of Work A national leader in early childhood career development, the Cajon Valley World of Work initiative engages students in hands-on experience right in their classrooms with a wide variety of careers, preparing them for their futures. World of Work uses each student’s interests, values, and strengths to tailor exploration, simulations, and virtual field trips with career professionals. Beginning in the Freshman year, all high school and post-secondary students will leverage early childhood interest exploration to identify and serve off-campus internships with highly qualified mentors. Local partners such as San Diego Workforce Partnership and Biocom are already playing a role in defining World of Work opportunities and engaging with our students.  Difference Making On-campus studio exploration empowers student entrepreneurs, makers, and inventors to impact their communities and world through their work and ideas. Students engage in community-based projects that tap their interests and strengths to make a meaningful difference in others’ lives. Their impact is amplified by our school’s multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural approach to learning. An example may include designing, building, and installing an equine sensory trail for children with autism.  Family Connection Accomplishing our vision challenges us to think differently about how we work together with students, families, and our community. Truly personalizing education beyond mere academic work involves looking at each student holistically. Families know their children best and they must play a proactive role in their children’s learning, collaborating in the planning and assessment of their student’s work.  Reimagining Postsecondary  Our goal is to push beyond dual and concurrent enrollment in community college to a coherent TK-14 experience, moving toward a strengths-based, truly personalized postsecondary experience that results in gainful employment opportunities in our immediate community. It is not our intent to partner with a community college to mirror or offer their program. Rather, create an integrated approach that builds on our World of Work initiative by extending internship and coursework beyond high school. Post high school students will maintain a relationship with an industry mentor and receive “wrap-around” services. Their Bostonia advisor, social worker, career counselor, and support staff will ensure an Associates’ degree and/or certificate of completion.",NA,NA,"75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,"wintern@cajonvalley.net","Nerel Winter","CEO",NA,NA,NA,"NewSchools Venture Fund"

Additionally, we support college and career readiness through the intentional development of a pathway to concurrent enrollment courses early in the High School Experience. There are career and mentorship opportunities through our Enrichment programming twice a week during the school day; we partner with local organizations to curate experiences for scholars to receive instruction in areas of interest like audio production, cybersecurity certification, coding and programming, and cultural exploration. Competency as measured by the ACCUplacer exam is a graduation requirement for our school district. We administer the assessment within the first 6 weeks of our scholars' High School experience as 9th graders. This serves as a benchmark for where they are in terms of accomplishing a graduation requirement and allows us to begin planning for the Spring semester course selections. Scholars who demonstrate competency become eligible for enrollment in courses that bear High School and College credit (Concurrent Enrollment).

The time is spent in a mix of whole school gatherings and with a consistent small group of students who serve as the """"home base"""" for the year. - Weekly Student Schedules: Weekly, students submit weekly plans that are authentic to the lives and responsibilities of each student. - Study Hall: After advisory, students have the option to attend study hall in order to connect with subject-matter educators to get targeted support in their coursework. They can bring questions that are coming up in their digital coursework, get feedback, or sign up to go deeper in a specific area. - Weekly Coaching: Students are paired with an educator who serves as their coach for the year. At a minimum, they meet 1:1 weekly to for a dedicated session focused on building the habits of success that enables students to thrive in this model in beyond. Coaches are there to help students set goals, monitor progress, and advocate for the supports they need. Coaches will also be able to support students through targeted interventions when needed.  - PMC Journeys: Across the year, students will propose and complete projects that enable them to explore passions and possible career paths. This might look like completing independent study on the future of AI or interning with a local non-profit to learn about child development.

In the past, Joy’s lens on student outcomes was traditional– it measured all young people by the same standard and relied on state test scores as the main success indicator. These are hallmarks of the industrial model: the mainstream model for education seen in a large majority of schools across the country, which prioritizes obedience and conformity. This model is drastically misaligned to the skills and qualities needed for modern-day careers, and widespread data reveals that the industrial model is reinforcing and compounding the socioeconomic and racial inequities it was founded on. Our Board and leadership chose not to move forward with Joy’s previous model, due to our belief that the industrial model, in any form, is incapable of producing equity. Given how fundamentally incompatible the industrial model is with our vision, we have opted to build an entirely new model from the ground up that centers equity, liberation, and an expanded definition of success.  Our redesign team’s first mission was to develop a Portrait of a Learner: an agreed upon set of school-level aspirations for what every young person will know and be able to do by the time they leave Joy. It defines the aims that young people will work towards: Agile, Critically Conscious, Creative, and Collaborative. Developing the Portrait provided an anchor to frame conversations with the Joy community about our collective aspirations for the young people we work with, and to challenge the beliefs that have been held implicitly in Joy’s past ways of operating. Each of our aims is designed with real-world authenticity in mind, so they’re deliberately interdisciplinary, and intentionally combine traditionally academic and non-academic skills. We’ve begun developing sets of indicators that identify the sub-skills within each aim and quantify levels of achievement. In the future, we plan to create robust toolkits for each aim that contain a holistic picture of what it looks like to support young people in developing the aim. In addition to indicators, these toolkits will have guidance for adults as to how to set the conditions for young people to develop and practice the aims. They will also explain the connection between the design decisions in Joy’s new model and the aims themselves, illustrating why we have chosen to allocate time in the way that we have, and how our various practices are aligned to the Portrait.  It’s clear that given the scope and content of our Portrait, our model overall will need to look at learning very differently. We believe the best way to grant young people “at-bats” with the aims is to structure learning in an inquiry-based format, where projects are based in real-world design challenges. We believe that this approach to learning positions skills in their authentic context, and puts young people in the driver's seat: two conditions that we view as essential for achieving the aims in our Portrait. We’re particularly interested in exploring inquiry-based learning with a design thinking lens, because we see a lot of philosophical alignment with our beliefs about the purpose of education. Given that we believe education has both a personal and a larger civic purpose, we’re interested in incorporating design thinking as a process that helps young people grow their sense of agency and explore their place as citizens in a democratic society.  We are also interested in mixed-age groupings because we believe strongly in personalizing learning for each young person while also nurturing relationships across ages and levels of experience. We’d like to design a learning experience driven by individualized goals and pathways, and move outside of the efficiency-based tradition for same-age groupings. Similarly, we’re inspired by school models that prioritize wide exploration of the arts and other activities typically viewed as extracurricular, and intrigued by the benefits that this could provide for individual growth and identity-development. We’d like to implement a cohort model with mixed ages, with a focus on developing a strong sense of community. We’re interested in integrating our cohort model fully into the “regular” learning structure, so that young people are positioned to access learning opportunities from a place of psychological safety.  As we do this work, we intend to stand up an incubator for education innovation here in Durham, where educators across the state and beyond come to learn about what could be possible. We believe that there’s a unique opportunity at Joy, given the high level of support from the Board and leadership, and given the existing talent. In our experience, these conditions are rare and special.",NA,NA,"50 - 74% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",NA,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,"dcannon@joycharter.org","Donnell Cannon","Executive Director","sman@joycharter.org","Sayre Man","Lead Designer","Transcend"

As an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School, our students are inspired to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and global citizens. We have a profound understanding that humans are natural inquirers, they want to learn and explore in an environment that is safe and engaging. We are developing growth mindsets in our students where they embrace the struggle and understand that the struggle is part of the journey. Teaching is student centered and curriculum is focused on imparting knowledge as well as teaching students to be caring, principled, reflective, balanced, open minded, inquirers, risk takers and thinkers.   Key Elements:   ● Children deserve to be taught at their instructional levels to achieve an education that is rigorous and engaging. When students are taught at instructional levels, they can reach their highest potential of learning as well as being leaders and strong mentors. In every Alturas classroom, instruction is provided in small groups, at instructional. We believe that categorizing students by grade levels limits their ability to reach their academic potential. Students constantly collaborate and communicate with partners and group members. They are taught the importance of taking ownership of their own education and supporting their classmates. Through small group learning the students foster analytical and critical thinking skills and explore real life world problems where every member of the group contributes. They collaborate, question, and discover the world around them.   ● The multi-age classroom is a unique style of teaching that provides student support through peer mentoring and peer collaboration. Another positive aspect to multi-aged classrooms is that students will remain with the same teacher for up to three years. This allows teachers to learn students’ strengths and needs quickly, and to meet students’ needs across an extended period. Our model is based on best practices in education.   ● In classrooms, the teacher primarily acts as a facilitator/trainer to help students become independent, collaborative learners. Our educators teach with our students not at them. They never sit down throughout the day as they are constantly engaged with their students. They go from one instructional group to another giving lessons as students independently take responsibility and guide their learning. Emphasis is placed on the classroom as a collaborative, safe, and supportive community.   ● Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through challenging work, good strategies, and input from others have a growth mindset. Having a growth mindset is essential in this model and understanding that making mistakes, respecting, and analyzing others’ opinion is part of the learning process. Teaching excellence is gained through engagement and collaboration and developing the 21st Century skills of communication, collaboration, critical and creative thinking. Our program inspires to make learning relevant, develop higher- level thinking skills, promote teamwork as a process, and incorporate technology as a learning tool. In the end, our commitment to our vision is unwavering. Our mission statement strongly reflects our goals and achievements. Alturas promotes academic distinction, while empowering students to be principled and intellectual leaders as they explore, create, investigate, and analyze in a safe, engaged, collaborative.",NA,NA,"0 - 24% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Woman",NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"michelle.ball@alturasacademy.org","Michelle Ball","Executive Director",NA,NA,NA,"Bluum"

These two elements embody a transformative approach to education, centering around enhancing the student experience through a blend of cultural relevance, experiential learning, and creative exploration. The learning is meticulously designed to cater to diverse learning needs, fostering a holistic development of students by integrating various learning modalities and Indigenous pedagogies. Here’s a summary highlighting the multifaceted experiences offered:  Cultural Engagement and Literacy: Students in grades 7-8 participate in a critical examination of library books to identify representations of Native cultures, encouraging discussions on authorship and cultural authenticity. This activity not only deepens their understanding of their heritage but also builds critical literacy skills.  Historical Contextualization and Empathy: For 5-6th graders, a Book Club focusing on American Girl stories was selected by the students. This opportunity for deep analysis offers a gateway to exploring historical contexts, further enriched by activities like planting """"Victory Gardens"""" and learning knitting, linking past and present.  Artistic Expression and Digital Literacy: A Mixed Media course offers hands-on experience with digital tools like Photoshop and Canva, alongside traditional artistic mediums, fostering artistic competency and digital literacy among students.  Experiential Learning: Projects like creating winter counts, designing personal medallions, and making ribbon skirts/shirts not only honor cultural traditions but also incorporate practical skills like sewing, embodying experiential learning.  Sustainability and STEAM: Activities like building fish traps and identifying rocks introduce students to sustainability concepts within a STEAM framework, emphasizing environmental stewardship and practical knowledge application.  Well-being and Restorative Practices: The program's emphasis on student and staff well-being, through calm rooms and a values-based approach to discipline, reflects a commitment to nurturing a supportive and respectful learning environment.  Innovative Scheduling and Pedagogy: Takuku challenges traditional educational models by offering diverse course options and employing Indigenous learning principles, aiming to expand students' cognitive abilities and metacognitive awareness.  While still in its infancy and a continued work in progress, this work represents a drastic shift in our educational approach, aiming to reshape our learning environment to better meet the holistic needs of students.

ACE provides a rigorous college-preparation pathway in which students are placed in multi-age, honors-levelled classes based on their skill levels and graduate with a Brookline High School diploma when they complete their content and skill competencies. Because the students are in small classes, they benefit from personalized instruction and a tight-knit community of staff and students. Students in ACE are expected to frequently reflect on their personal growth in developing habits of success and actively engage in the ACE community through their participation in their advisory and in community building activities. ACE students take all of their core academic subjects including English, Math, History and Science in the program while still taking their electives, world language, and health and fitness classes in mainstream. They take two six-week academic classes at a time, averaging three courses in each content area in a given school year. When it is time to assess the student, ACE teachers offer a choice of performance-based assessments that, as much as possible, allow students real-world application of the skills. If a student does not meet a minimum level of competency, “basic competency,” in a class, they do not fail. Instead, they repeat it when it is offered next or take an on-line version of the course, if available. A limited number of ACE online classes are also available for students who want to move at a quicker pace. Even though many ACE students would otherwise take an AP class, they choose not to because they are seeking a more innovative and experiential classroom experience. If an ACE student is seeking a college class experience, ACE places students in actual college classes through dual-enrollment programs at Roxbury Community College and Ben Franklin Institute of Technology where they can earn college credit. In ACE, students also have the option of pursuing internships during school hours for academic credit. This gives students the chance to work with a mentor at a workplace of interest where they do a comprehensive project that is needed by that internship site. In addition to their academic experiences, ACE students participate in community building trips and community service projects which allow students to build a supportive, trusting environment. ACE also works closely with families to be an active partner in their child’s success. Parents or guardians are expected to come in three times a year to participate in a student-run exhibition on their child’s academic progress.",NA,NA,"25 - 49% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"Amy_Bayer@psbma.org","Amy Bayer","ACE Program Coordinator",NA,NA,NA,"Aurora Institute"
